# Release zip manifest (for the assembler, not the recipient)

The release zip holds these pieces. Everything sits at the zip root except `tools\unzbd.exe`;
the recipient unzips and double-clicks `CSVM.exe`, which extracts the game data from inside the
engine on first start. The zip carries no script.

`ExportRelease.ps1` assembles it: it exports into `.scratch\export\`, copies the rows below in
beside the export output, and zips that folder to `.scratch\CSVM-v<version>-win64.zip`, the version
being `application/config/version` from `CSVM/project.godot` — the same number the exe's file
properties and the first line of every log state. This file is the
statement of what belongs in the zip; the script is what performs it, so a copied row added here
needs a matching entry in the script's `$ReleaseFiles`. Two rows are not copies and say so in
their Source column: the export's own output, and `BUILD-INFO.txt`, whose content differs on
every run and therefore has no repo home to be copied from. Two rows are in the table without
being in the zip at all, `LICENSE-plmpeg` and `LICENSE-promptfont`, because they are inputs the
notices file is assembled from; their Zip path column names them as no zip row and they take no
`$ReleaseFiles` entry.

| Zip path | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CSVM.exe` + export payload (`.pck`/`.dll`s etc.) | the Godot release export output | Whatever the export produces at its root, copied verbatim; the exe's file properties carry the version |
| `tools\unzbd.exe` | `Z:\CSVM\tools\mech3ax\target\release\unzbd.exe` | The fork build (branch `cs-anim`), NOT the pinned v0.6.1 binary (Decision 5). The engine runs it as a child process, from the Extract screen or `--extract`; it is never linked |
| `SDL2.dll` | `tools/sdl2/SDL2.dll` | The official libsdl-org SDL 2.32.10 Windows x64 runtime, which the game reads flight sticks through. Installed by `InstallSdl2.ps1` against a pinned SHA-256; the game loads it from beside the exe (`docs/tooling.md`, "SDL2 for flight sticks") |
| `README-SDL.txt` | `tools/sdl2/README-SDL.txt` | From the same release zip, which asks for it to be distributed with the runtime |
| `LICENSE-SDL2.txt` | `tools/sdl2/LICENSE.txt` | SDL's zlib licence, read by `InstallSdl2.ps1` from the release's own commit because the runtime zip carries none; renamed so it does not read as CSVM's licence |
| `libwebrtc_native.windows.template_release.x86_64.dll` | the Godot release export output, from `CSVM/addons/webrtc_native/` | webrtc-native 1.2.2, the transport internet play runs over (`docs/tooling.md`, "The WebRTC library and the master server"). The export runs `InstallWebRtc.ps1` into the exported tree first, so the pinned, hash-checked release is always the one shipped, and throws if the export left the library out |
| `LICENSE-webrtc\LICENSE.*` | `CSVM/addons/webrtc_native/LICENSE.*` | The seven licence files the webrtc-native release carries: its own (MIT), libdatachannel and libjuice (MPL-2.0), libsrtp, usrsctp (BSD), mbedtls (Apache-2.0) and plog (MIT). `BUILD-INFO.txt` names the release tag, which is where the MPL-2.0 source is |
| `README.md` | `packaging/README.md` | The one document a downloader reads: the releases page and the zip's SHA-256, the requirements including the renderer floor, the extraction and first flight, the log and save locations, what the other files here are, and where to report a problem. Author-reviewed before any hand-off or release (standing rule: the author owns outward communication) |
| `LICENSE` | `packaging/LICENSE` | GPL-3, byte-identical to repo root `LICENSE` |
| `LICENSE-unzbd` | `packaging/LICENSE-unzbd` | EUPL-1.2, byte-identical to `tools/mech3ax/LICENSE` |
| `LICENSE-thirdparty.txt` | `packaging/LICENSE-thirdparty.txt` | The notices the two binaries' contents oblige the zip to carry: the Godot engine, its own third-party components, the self-contained .NET runtime, and the Rust crates and the Rust standard library in `unzbd.exe` (section 9, read from the pinned toolchain's `share/doc/rust/COPYRIGHT-library.html` and `licenses/`), plus one notice for source rather than payload, `pl_mpeg`, which CSVM's managed MPEG-1 decoder is ported from, and the SIL Open Font License for PromptFont, the font packed into the export that the pad glyphs are drawn from. Assembled by `packaging/BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1` from the shipped artefacts themselves; its header names the three payload versions it speaks for, plus the `win-x64` runtime pack and the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` crate target, and the export refuses to ship it against any other |
| none, not a zip row | `packaging/LICENSE-plmpeg` | An input to the row above, not a payload: `BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1` reads it into section 7 of the notices file, so it ships inside that file and never beside it. It holds the MIT terms because `pl_mpeg` declares MIT by SPDX identifier alone and publishes no licence file for the script to read out of an artefact |
| none, not a zip row | `packaging/LICENSE-promptfont` | An input to the notices row, not a payload: `BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1` reads it into section 8, under the copyright statement it reads out of `CSVM/data/promptfont.ttf.bin`'s own name table. Byte-identical to the `LICENSE.txt` in PromptFont's release, which is the bare OFL text with no copyright line of its own |
| `BUILD-INFO.txt` | GENERATED by `ExportRelease.ps1` | Which commit each shipped binary was built from: CSVM's `HEAD` and the mech3ax `cs-anim` commit, each with whether its worktree was clean, plus whether `cs-anim` is pushed, and the SDL release, commit and DLL hash `SDL2.dll` came from, and the webrtc-native release and library hash. `PublishRelease.ps1` reads it and refuses a release carrying any of those qualifiers |

## Linux tarball

`ExportRelease.ps1 -Linux` also exports the `Linux/X11` preset into `.scratch\export-linux\` and
packs it inside WSL (Debian) as `.scratch\CSVM-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz`, entries at the
archive root like the zip's. It is the zip's payload with the Linux README, the Linux notices and
the Linux unzbd in place of the Windows ones, its text files staged LF (the bytes git stores; the
zip keeps the checkout's CRLF), and without the three SDL2 rows: the Linux build reads flight sticks
through the system's `libSDL2-2.0.so.0` (on SteamOS, sdl2-compat over SDL3), found through the
system loader, and runs without sticks when it is absent. The tarball ships no SDL2, so its
`BUILD-INFO.txt` has no SDL block (`docs/tooling.md`, "SDL2 for flight sticks"). Modes are set in the archive, root-owned: `0755` for the two executables and every
directory, `0644` for everything else, and the script reads the two executables' modes back out of
the archive before it reports success.

| Tarball path | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CSVM.x86_64` + `data_CSVM_linuxbsd_x86_64/` | the Godot `Linux/X11` release export output | `0755`; the pck is embedded as in the Windows exe. The data folder holds the self-contained linux-x64 .NET runtime |
| `tools/unzbd` | `-LinuxUnzbd`, default `tools\mech3ax\target\x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\release\unzbd` | `0755`; the static musl build of the same fork commit as `unzbd.exe` |
| `README.md` | `packaging/README-linux.md` | The Linux README: the community-tested label, requirements (x86_64, Vulkan), unpacking with the executable bits, where the original game's folder comes from, the in-game extraction, the "On Steam Deck" section, logs, the settings folder and the licences. Author-reviewed before release like the zip's README; `$LinuxReadme` in the script names it |
| `libwebrtc_native.linux.template_release.x86_64.so` | the Godot `Linux/X11` release export output | `0644`; the Linux library of the same webrtc-native release as the zip's DLL |
| `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-unzbd`, `LICENSE-webrtc/LICENSE.*` | as in the zip | |
| `LICENSE-thirdparty.txt` | `packaging/LICENSE-thirdparty-linux.txt` | The zip's notice assembled from the Linux payload instead, by `BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1 -Linux`: the same Godot sections (the engine compiles them from one `COPYRIGHT.txt` on every platform, and the script checks that the Linux template reports the editor's build), the `linux-x64` runtime pack's own `LICENSE.TXT` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT`, the crate tree cargo resolves for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (`libc` and the backtrace crates in, `windows-sys` and its companions out), a section 9 for the Rust standard library read from the WSL toolchain, which adds std's backtrace crates (`addr2line`, `adler2`, `memchr`, `miniz_oxide`, `object`) that `COPYRIGHT-library.html` does not list, and a section 10 for the musl C library linked statically into `tools/unzbd`. Its header stamps the `linux-x64` pack and the musl target; the export refuses it unless they and the three version stamps match, and refuses it if it names any Windows payload file, pack or target. No SDL section: the tarball ships no SDL2 |
| none, not a tarball row | `packaging/LICENSE-musl` | An input to the row above: section 10's text, the `COPYRIGHT` file of the musl-1.2.3 release byte-identical (SHA-256 `f9bc4423732350eb0b3f7ed7e91d530298476f8fec0c6c427a1c04ade22655af`; `.gitattributes` marks it `-text`, so no checkout converts its LF endings). Rust 1.91.1's musl target links its own bundled `libc.a`, which carries no licence text; its version is read off its symbols (`qsort_r` and the LFS64 names present, `statx` absent). `BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1` refuses to run when `tools/mech3ax/rust-toolchain.toml` pins another Rust, since a new toolchain can bundle another musl |
| `BUILD-INFO.txt` | GENERATED, as in the zip | The same commits, with the Linux file names and LF line endings. `PublishRelease.ps1` reads it out of the tarball and refuses the same qualifiers as the zip's |

Not in the zip, created on the recipient's machine by the engine's extraction: `extracted\` (game data —
must never ship; the zip contains zero game assets by construction).

Assembly checks before hand-off. The copies are taken from the sources above on every export,
so byte-identity is by construction and only the unzbd build needs confirming:

- `tools\unzbd.exe` is the fork build: `unzbd.exe --version` shows the fork's build
  timestamp, and its SHA-256 should match the `unzbdSha256` a dev-tree extraction stamps
  into `extracted/VERSION.json`. The script checks the path exists, not which build it is.
- `LICENSE-thirdparty.txt` needs no manual check: the export reads the Godot build, .NET runtime
  version and `cs-anim` commit out of each notice's header and throws if any disagrees with what
  it is packaging, or if a notice's runtime pack and crate target stamps are not its platform's.
  Regenerate with `packaging\BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1` (add `-Linux` for the tarball's) when one
  does; a `-Linux` run rewrites both files. `sandbox\LinuxRelease.ps1`'s payload stage repeats the
  Linux half on the built tarball's own copy. ⚠ A moved
  `cs-anim` counts even when the fork's own code did not change, because the file enumerates that
  commit's crate tree. The `pl_mpeg` section carries no such stamp and needs none: it speaks for
  source CSVM's own code was ported from, which moves with CSVM's commit rather than with a payload
  version, and `BUILD-INFO.txt` already records that commit.
- The three SDL2 rows need no manual check: the export runs `InstallSdl2.ps1 -Verify`, which
  throws unless all three match their pinned SHA-256, and `BUILD-INFO.txt` records the SDL version,
  commit and DLL hash.
- The WebRTC rows need no manual check either: the export installs the pinned release, which
  `InstallWebRtc.ps1` refuses unless its SHA-256 matches, and throws if the exported folder holds
  no library.
- Everything in the staging folder goes into the zip, so the script deletes `.scratch\export\`
  at the start of every run: what is in the archive is what that run produced, never a leftover
  from an earlier export or a hand assembly.

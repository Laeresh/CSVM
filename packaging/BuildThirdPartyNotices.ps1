.SYNOPSIS
    Regenerates packaging/LICENSE-thirdparty.txt from the payloads and the ported source
    it speaks for.

.DESCRIPTION
    The release zip ships CSVM.exe (the Godot engine statically linked), a self-contained
    .NET runtime beside it, and tools/unzbd.exe (a Rust binary). Each carries notice
    obligations that CSVM's own LICENSE and LICENSE-unzbd do not cover, so the assembled
    file is what discharges them. A fourth obligation is not a payload at all: CSVM's
    managed MPEG-1 decoder is a port of pl_mpeg, and MIT requires the notice to travel
    with the derived source.

    The three payload sources are read from the artefacts themselves rather than from a
    copy of upstream's website:

    - Godot. The Windows distribution ships NO LICENSE.txt or COPYRIGHT.txt on disk, and
      neither does the export-template archive: the engine keeps both texts inside the
      binary and hands them back through Engine.get_license_text(),
      get_copyright_info() and get_license_info(). So this script runs the pinned editor
      headless over a throwaway project and reads them out of the same binary the export
      templates were cut from. The dump project is built in TEMP, never in CSVM/, so no
      Godot run here can touch project.godot.
    - .NET. A self-contained publish copies the Microsoft.NETCore.App runtime pack into
      the payload, and that pack ships LICENSE.TXT (MIT) plus THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT.
      Those two files are the notice the publish requires, taken from the exact version
      in the NuGet cache rather than from the machine-wide dotnet install, which is a
      different (usually newer) build.
    - unzbd. EUPL-1.2 covers mech3ax's own code, not the crates statically linked into
      the binary, whose MIT and Apache terms want their own copyright notices carried.
      cargo resolves them for the target triple and each crate's licence text is read
      out of the registry checkout it was built from. Texts are deduplicated by content,
      so the identical Apache-2.0 sixty crates ship appears once.

    pl_mpeg is the exception to that rule, and cannot be anything else: upstream declares
    MIT through an SPDX-License-Identifier line in its header and publishes no licence
    file, so there is no upstream text to read. The terms are therefore kept in this
    repository as packaging/LICENSE-plmpeg, and the section says in the shipped file where
    that text came from so a reader is not misled into taking it for a verbatim copy.

    ExportRelease.ps1 checks the three version stamps this script writes into the file's
    header against what it is actually packaging, and refuses an export whose notice was
    assembled for a different engine, runtime or fork commit. That check is what makes a
    stale notice a build failure rather than a silent shipping mistake. pl_mpeg carries no
    such stamp because it is source this project derives from rather than a binary the zip
    carries: it moves with CSVM's own history, which BUILD-INFO.txt already records.

pl_mpeg declares its terms as the line SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT in its

header itself, so there is no upstream text to copy. What follows is therefore
the standard MIT licence with pl_mpeg's author named as the copyright holder,

CSVM third-party notices
========================

This file carries the notices that the third-party software inside this build is
licensed on condition of carrying, and one notice for third-party source CSVM's own
code is ported from. It is not CSVM's own licence: CSVM is under the GNU General
Public License v3, whose text is in LICENSE beside this file, and the extractor
tools\unzbd.exe is under the EUPL-1.2, whose text is in LICENSE-unzbd.

This archive contains no Crimson Skies code, data or artwork. The game files a
player extracts with Extract.ps1 stay on their own machine.

Assembled from these exact payload versions, which ExportRelease.ps1 re-checks
against what it packages before it will build a zip:

  Godot Engine build: $godotBuild
  .NET runtime version: $RuntimeVersion
  mech3ax cs-anim commit: $forkCommit

Regenerate with packaging\BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1, which reads every text in
sections 1 to 6 out of the shipped artefacts themselves. Section 7 is the one
exception and says so in its own text: pl_mpeg publishes no licence file to read.

are listed below with the SPDX expression each crate's Cargo.toml declares.

The list is every non-workspace package cargo resolves for

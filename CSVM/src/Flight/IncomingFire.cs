/// shield behind them deterministically, without an AI gunner (which has to find its shot) or a
/// second pilot in splitscreen. Fires the target's own gun (or the named weapon) into the shared
/// pool under a shooter identity no player holds, so the rounds are real and land as any other
/// pilot's would, through <see cref="FlightController.TakeProjectileHit"/>. The muzzle sits
/// <see cref="Standoff"/> behind the aircraft, aimed along the target's own nose, so the round
/// overtakes on a parallel track. The metres argument offsets that track sideways, alternating
/// sides; at the default 0 the rounds land, and a wide offset is a rig that hits nothing, which is
/// what makes it the able-to-fail control.

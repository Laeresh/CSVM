/// grep for in the extraction is useless for this job. Nodes without that meta (our own

/// <para><b>Why it is bounded.</b> A chapter world is thousands of nodes; labelling all of
/// them at once is unreadable and slow. So labels are limited to <see cref="MaxLabels"/>
/// nearest the camera within <see cref="Radius"/>, and the selection is recomputed on a timer
/// rather than per frame (positions are static in world space and the labels billboard
/// themselves, so a slower cadence is invisible). The candidate walk is redone on the same
/// timer because the tree genuinely changes in flight — MapEdgeExtender adds and drops
/// border tiles as you cross cells.</para>
///
/// <para>Off by default and it builds nothing until switched on, so screenshots are

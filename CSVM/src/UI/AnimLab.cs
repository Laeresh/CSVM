/// selection's ancestor ladder is current (PgUp/PgDn walk it); WASD/QE cancels the follow,
/// mouse-look and the wheel keep it.</para>
///
/// <para>The clock is the session's <see cref="GameClock"/>, which the lab only drives: pause =

/// fixed step per rendered frame in a scripted <c>--screenshot</c> run, so a
/// <c>--frames</c>/<c>--shots</c> capture lands on exact step counts. The render rate never
/// changes simulation results. The RNG is re-pinned on every Play/Restart, so a seeded replay

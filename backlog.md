# Backlog, unscheduled future work

Everything known-but-not-scheduled, so it survives between polish runs. Which plan is active, if
any, is `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`'s "Current status", never restated here. Per-item history/diagnosis
detail is in commit messages (`git log --grep=BL-NNN`; earlier in the archived development log's
dated entries) and `docs/architecture.md` (module bullets); how to
verify a change without fooling yourself is `docs/verification.md`. **The live list of hand-tuned
constants awaiting playtest is the set of items tagged `[Tuning]`** (consolidated actionable
index: [`playtest.md`](playtest.md)). When an item gets scheduled into a plan, move it there; when
it lands, delete it here.

**Item IDs.** Every entry carries a flat `BL-NNN` tag, assigned once at minting and never
renumbered or reused, even when the item it names is deleted, so a stale cross-reference elsewhere
fails loudly instead of silently pointing at the wrong item. **Mint a new ID by running
`./New-ItemId.ps1 -Kind BL`**, never by scanning this file or taking "max + 1" by hand. The
counter lives in `.git/item-id-counters.json` (shared by every worktree, outside version
control) and the script increments it under an exclusive file lock, so two concurrent sessions
cannot be handed the same number.
⚠ **Run it for EVERY id, every time, it is not a once-per-session lookup.** Minting one id and
then deriving the next by adding 1, or reusing a number the script handed you earlier in the
session, desynchronises the counter from the file: the id you invented is not recorded, so the
next call hands it out again and the duplicate-id hook fails a later commit. Need several at
once? `-Count n` reserves a block in one call. The failure is silent at the time and surfaces
in someone else's commit, which is why the rule is absolute rather than a default.

**Structure.** Items are grouped into twelve theme sections, in this fixed order: Damage &
destruction · Weapons & combat · Flight model & collision physics · Environment & world · Effects
& animation runtime · Audio · Cameras & views · HUD & UI · Splitscreen · Missions, modes &
campaign · Tooling, platform & docs · Misc. Within a theme, items sort by ascending ID. A straddler goes to the theme
whose system you would open to fix it; Misc is the escape hatch for items with no such system,
if it grows past a handful, that is a missing theme, not a working bucket. Splitscreen is the one
cross-cutting exception: an item whose subject is the single-viewer/single-player assumption goes
there, even though the fix opens another theme's system.

Every item is one flat bullet:

    - `BL-NNN` `[Type]` `[Status?]` `[Size]` `[Next: …]` `[Impact: …]` `[Evidence: …]` `[Scope?]` **One-sentence claim, the symptom or goal.** body…

`[Type]` is exactly one of: `[Bug]` (behaviour is wrong vs the original or vs intent),
`[Feature]` (something the engine does not do yet), `[Research]` (the deliverable is an answer,
not code), `[Tuning]` (a hand-tuned constant needing judgement at the controls), `[Cleanup]`
(debt with no player-visible behaviour change), `[Fidelity]` (the mechanism is decoded and ours
differs, with no symptom yet), `[Perf]` (frame time or memory), `[Tooling]` (scripts, hooks and
the verification loop), `[Testing]` (a missing test or test aid). The optional status tag is `[Owed-playtest]`
(the code/constant side is done; what is missing is a human at the controls) or
`[Blocked: <blocker>]` (cannot start regardless of priority, the blocker is named: a capture
`CAP-nn`, a milestone, another item, an upstream release, a user decision). No status tag means
open and unblocked.

**Property tags** follow the type and status tags, in this fixed order, and say what a full read
of the body would say, so that the artifact can filter on them. `CheckItemIds.ps1` rejects a value
outside these vocabularies; it does not require the tags, so an item minted without them still
commits, and they are added when its body is next reshaped.
- `[S]` / `[M]` / `[L]` is the fix's size by shape, never by hours: `S` is one file, one constant,
  a test-only or doc-only change, or a close with no code; `M` is one subsystem, a few files, or a
  change that re-pins goldens; `L` is plan-sized, cross-cutting, or needs a design first.
- `[Next: decode|data|code|look|decide]` is the first step before the item can move: `decode`
  reads the original executable; `data` reads extracted game data, footage or a measurement;
  `code` writes code or tests now with nothing owed first; `look` needs a human at the controls
  (every `[Owed-playtest]` item and every `CAP-nn` blocker); `decide` needs a user decision.
- `[Impact: high|low|none]` is what a player would notice if the item were done: `high` shows in
  ordinary play, `low` is subtle, rare or only visible when looked for, `none` is cleanup, tooling,
  instrumentation or a research answer with no visible change.
- `[Evidence: decoded|data|footage|spec|feel|trace]` is the strongest source the item's
  *Evidence:* line rests on, in the standing notes' order of trust: an executable decode, extracted
  data files, a capture under `OriginalScreenshots/`, the pre-release design spec, or a feel report
  or estimate. `trace` is the case with no original-game source at all: a read of CSVM's own code,
  a log or a profile.
- `[Scope]` is optional and names the one mission or scene the item is tied to (`[CM14]`, `[C5]`,
  `[MP1]`), spelled as the item spells it. An item that spans missions carries none.

**Body template for new entries** (existing bodies are reshaped opportunistically, when an edit
touches them anyway): after the bold title sentence, labelled run-in lines, each present only
when it has content, *Evidence:* (what was measured or checked, with `file:line`/data paths,
the one field every entry should have) · *Fix shape:* · *⚠ Traps:* (mechanisms already ruled
out, unit ambiguities, "do not fix it by X") · *Playtest after fix:* (launch command + what to
look for) · *Cross-refs:* (related `BL-nnn`/`CAP-nn`/docs, with why).

## Standing notes

- **Scheduled items live in their plan, do not re-add them here.** If one is closed without
  landing, its record goes in the closing commit's message.
- **[`playtest.md`](playtest.md) is the actionable, consolidated checklist** for everything
  tagged `[Owed-playtest]` or blocked on a `CAP-nn`, what to look for, the launch command, and
  what each blocks. The backlog keeps the deep evidence/traps; keep the two in step.
- **Reference shots are in `OriginalScreenshots/`** (gitignored, cited by filename).
- Bare code paths are relative to the Godot project's `src/`.
- **On the original pre-release design spec:** its structural claims have held up against our
  data, per-hardpoint cluster sizes, the 8-firepoint rig, the zeppelin launch-altitude gate, the
  two-volume danger zones, the armour/health damage split. Its per-item art and balance numbers
  have repeatedly failed, gun ranges, rocket speeds, zone hit points, the crash fireball's
  timing, shell ejection's calibre gate and mount position. Take the mechanism from it, never the
  magnitudes or the art direction, and prefer extracted data or an `OriginalScreenshots/` capture
  wherever either exists. Where an entry rests on the document alone, it says so and marks the
  value TUNE.
- **The flight constants are coupled and `--run-tests` guards them.** Thrust sets speed, speed
  scales the yaw `eff`, so a change in one moves others; `FlightEnvelopeTests` asserts five
  decoded scenarios and will fail if a change breaks one. There is no thrust scale left to turn:
  thrust is `EnginePower · ref_area · curve(Mach) · lever`, every number in it is the executable's,
  and the level-equilibrium curve it produces is asserted per airframe and per lever position
  ([`docs/org/flightModel.md`](docs/org/flightModel.md), "Part-throttle equilibrium"). Chasing a
  *transient* or a feel report through the force path is the forbidden move. ⚠ **`PitchTune`/`YawTune`/`RollTune` are no longer
  in that category: all three are 1, because `FUN_0048c470` carries no per-axis factor on any axis
  ([`docs/org/flightModel.md`](docs/org/flightModel.md), "The `*Tune` rates"), and
  `FlightConstantInventoryTests` now pins them there.** Every asserted target is the decoded
  plant's own value or a named exception; a footage figure that disagrees (the filmed 33.00 °/s
  pitch rate, the 28.60 s `yaw-360`, `accel-150-290`, `decel-290-150`) is discarded and kept only
  as row prose that gates nothing ([`docs/org/flightModel.md`](docs/org/flightModel.md), "Parity
  ledger"). `FlightScenarios` is 4.

## Splitscreen

Our splitscreen mode (2–4 players) has no counterpart in the original, so every rule it authored
against "the player" or "the camera" needs an explicit splitscreen verdict: generalise it, take a
nearest/union rule, or record it as deliberately single/global. This theme collects that work
(sweep of 2026-08-15). **Route fixes through the two existing seams instead of minting new ones:**
`GameSession.PlayerPositions` (nearest human) for gameplay rules that say "the player", and the
viewer set behind `ProjectilePool.Viewers` / `ScreenSize.NearestFloor` for draw rules that say
"the camera". Sim state stays global, the mission wind is the worked example
(`Session/WeatherRig.Tick`, stepped once per frame outside the per-rig loop on purpose).

# Backlog, unscheduled future work

Everything known-but-not-scheduled, so it survives between polish runs. Which plan is active, if
any, is `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`'s "Current status", never restated here. Per-item history/diagnosis
detail is in commit messages (`git log --grep=BL-NNN`; earlier in the archived development log's
dated entries) and `docs/architecture.md` (module bullets); how to
verify a change without fooling yourself is `docs/verification.md`. **The live list of hand-tuned
constants awaiting playtest is the set of items tagged `[Tuning]`** (consolidated actionable
index: [`playtest.md`](playtest.md)). When an item gets scheduled into a plan, move it there; when
it lands, delete it here.

**Item IDs.** Every entry carries a flat `BL-NNN` tag, assigned once at minting and never
renumbered or reused, even when the item it names is deleted, so a stale cross-reference elsewhere
fails loudly instead of silently pointing at the wrong item. **Mint a new ID by running
`./New-ItemId.ps1 -Kind BL`**, never by scanning this file or taking "max + 1" by hand. The
counter lives in `.git/item-id-counters.json` (shared by every worktree, outside version
control) and the script increments it under an exclusive file lock, so two concurrent sessions
cannot be handed the same number.
⚠ **Run it for EVERY id, every time, it is not a once-per-session lookup.** Minting one id and
then deriving the next by adding 1, or reusing a number the script handed you earlier in the
session, desynchronises the counter from the file: the id you invented is not recorded, so the
next call hands it out again and the duplicate-id hook fails a later commit. Need several at
once? `-Count n` reserves a block in one call. The failure is silent at the time and surfaces
in someone else's commit, which is why the rule is absolute rather than a default.

**Structure.** Items are grouped into twelve theme sections, in this fixed order: Damage &
destruction · Weapons & combat · Flight model & collision physics · Environment & world · Effects
& animation runtime · Audio · Cameras & views · HUD & UI · Splitscreen · Missions, modes &
campaign · Tooling, platform & docs · Misc. Within a theme, items sort by ascending ID. A straddler goes to the theme
whose system you would open to fix it; Misc is the escape hatch for items with no such system,
if it grows past a handful, that is a missing theme, not a working bucket. Splitscreen is the one
cross-cutting exception: an item whose subject is the single-viewer/single-player assumption goes
there, even though the fix opens another theme's system.

Every item is one flat bullet:

    - `BL-NNN` `[Type]` `[Status?]` `[Size]` `[Next: …]` `[Impact: …]` `[Evidence: …]` `[Scope?]` **One-sentence claim, the symptom or goal.** body…

`[Type]` is exactly one of: `[Bug]` (behaviour is wrong vs the original or vs intent),
`[Feature]` (something the engine does not do yet), `[Research]` (the deliverable is an answer,
not code), `[Tuning]` (a hand-tuned constant needing judgement at the controls), `[Cleanup]`
(debt with no player-visible behaviour change), `[Fidelity]` (the mechanism is decoded and ours
differs, with no symptom yet), `[Perf]` (frame time or memory), `[Tooling]` (scripts, hooks and
the verification loop), `[Testing]` (a missing test or test aid). The optional status tag is `[Owed-playtest]`
(the code/constant side is done; what is missing is a human at the controls) or
`[Blocked: <blocker>]` (cannot start regardless of priority, the blocker is named: a capture
`CAP-nn`, a milestone, another item, an upstream release, a user decision). No status tag means
open and unblocked.

**Property tags** follow the type and status tags, in this fixed order, and say what a full read
of the body would say, so that the artifact can filter on them. `CheckItemIds.ps1` rejects a value
outside these vocabularies; it does not require the tags, so an item minted without them still
commits, and they are added when its body is next reshaped.
- `[S]` / `[M]` / `[L]` is the fix's size by shape, never by hours: `S` is one file, one constant,
  a test-only or doc-only change, or a close with no code; `M` is one subsystem, a few files, or a
  change that re-pins goldens; `L` is plan-sized, cross-cutting, or needs a design first.
- `[Next: decode|data|code|look|decide]` is the first step before the item can move: `decode`
  reads the original executable; `data` reads extracted game data, footage or a measurement;
  `code` writes code or tests now with nothing owed first; `look` needs a human at the controls
  (every `[Owed-playtest]` item and every `CAP-nn` blocker); `decide` needs a user decision.
- `[Impact: high|low|none]` is what a player would notice if the item were done: `high` shows in
  ordinary play, `low` is subtle, rare or only visible when looked for, `none` is cleanup, tooling,
  instrumentation or a research answer with no visible change.
- `[Evidence: decoded|data|footage|spec|feel|trace]` is the strongest source the item's
  *Evidence:* line rests on, in the standing notes' order of trust: an executable decode, extracted
  data files, a capture under `OriginalScreenshots/`, the pre-release design spec, or a feel report
  or estimate. `trace` is the case with no original-game source at all: a read of CSVM's own code,
  a log or a profile.
- `[Scope]` is optional and names the one mission or scene the item is tied to (`[CM14]`, `[C5]`,
  `[MP1]`), spelled as the item spells it. An item that spans missions carries none.

**Body template for new entries** (existing bodies are reshaped opportunistically, when an edit
touches them anyway): after the bold title sentence, labelled run-in lines, each present only
when it has content, *Evidence:* (what was measured or checked, with `file:line`/data paths,
the one field every entry should have) · *Fix shape:* · *⚠ Traps:* (mechanisms already ruled
out, unit ambiguities, "do not fix it by X") · *Playtest after fix:* (launch command + what to
look for) · *Cross-refs:* (related `BL-nnn`/`CAP-nn`/docs, with why).

## Standing notes

- **Scheduled items live in their plan, do not re-add them here.** If one is closed without
  landing, its record goes in the closing commit's message.
- **[`playtest.md`](playtest.md) is the actionable, consolidated checklist** for everything
  tagged `[Owed-playtest]` or blocked on a `CAP-nn`, what to look for, the launch command, and
  what each blocks. The backlog keeps the deep evidence/traps; keep the two in step.
- **Reference shots are in `OriginalScreenshots/`** (gitignored, cited by filename).
- Bare code paths are relative to the Godot project's `src/`.
- **On the original pre-release design spec:** its structural claims have held up against our
  data, per-hardpoint cluster sizes, the 8-firepoint rig, the zeppelin launch-altitude gate, the
  two-volume danger zones, the armour/health damage split. Its per-item art and balance numbers
  have repeatedly failed, gun ranges, rocket speeds, zone hit points, the crash fireball's
  timing, shell ejection's calibre gate and mount position. Take the mechanism from it, never the
  magnitudes or the art direction, and prefer extracted data or an `OriginalScreenshots/` capture
  wherever either exists. Where an entry rests on the document alone, it says so and marks the
  value TUNE.
- **The flight constants are coupled and `--run-tests` guards them.** Thrust sets speed, speed
  scales the yaw `eff`, so a change in one moves others; `FlightEnvelopeTests` asserts five
  decoded scenarios and will fail if a change breaks one. There is no thrust scale left to turn:
  thrust is `EnginePower · ref_area · curve(Mach) · lever`, every number in it is the executable's,
  and the level-equilibrium curve it produces is asserted per airframe and per lever position
  ([`docs/org/flightModel.md`](docs/org/flightModel.md), "Part-throttle equilibrium"). Chasing a
  *transient* or a feel report through the force path is the forbidden move. ⚠ **`PitchTune`/`YawTune`/`RollTune` are no longer
  in that category: all three are 1, because `FUN_0048c470` carries no per-axis factor on any axis
  ([`docs/org/flightModel.md`](docs/org/flightModel.md), "The `*Tune` rates"), and
  `FlightConstantInventoryTests` now pins them there.** Every asserted target is the decoded
  plant's own value or a named exception; a footage figure that disagrees (the filmed 33.00 °/s
  pitch rate, the 28.60 s `yaw-360`, `accel-150-290`, `decel-290-150`) is discarded and kept only
  as row prose that gates nothing ([`docs/org/flightModel.md`](docs/org/flightModel.md), "Parity
  ledger"). `FlightScenarios` is 4.

## Damage & destruction

- `BL-060` `[Feature]` `[Blocked: the faithful crash settling]` `[L]` `[Next: code]` `[Impact: low]` `[Evidence: feel]` **Improve on the original crash, the bespoke "breaking apart" (branch `bespoke-crash-animation`).**
  *Decision:* stays parked on its branch; nothing is blended until the faithful recreation is settled.
  User's call (2026-07-23): the retired bespoke `CrashBreakup` wreck-scatter looked *better* than the
  faithful data-driven crash, so it was preserved on that branch rather than deleted. **The A/B playtest
  passed (2026-07-23), the faithful data-driven crash is confirmed as the default**, so this is now the
  standing follow-up: once the faithful recreation is fully settled, revisit blending the branch's nicer
  breaking-apart (free-body scatter + down-ray ground-rest) into (or over) the data-driven path, an
  explicit "improve on the original" opportunity, not a faithfulness regression.
  ⚠ **Traps (from slices 1–2, 2026-07-23).** The `blend`/`softParticles` `Puffer.Create` overrides
  exist and default to a byte-identical shader, reuse them; a MIX-blend dark puffer near the
  ground also needs `softParticles: false` or the depth-fade zeroes it. A fading additive fireball
  reads as smoke in a screenshot, isolate the emitter (suppress the others, freeze the crash with
  no `--hold`) before believing an effect is present. Anchor at the plane centre (`pose.Origin` =
  `healthy`), not the impact point. For the debris arcs, the executable decode governs now
  (`PLAN-object-motion-decode`, 2026-08-13): `translation_range` gives `dirY = elevation/90` and
  horizontal `1 − |elevation|/90` (an L1 direction, not spherical), `initial` the launch speed,
  `delta` an acceleration. The retired `DebrisTune.LaunchScale` of 0.65 was a footage fit laid over
  the earlier, wrong spherical reading and is deleted along with the whole tune class, a blend
  here starts from the authored arc, with no compensating scalar. The unscaled arc reads like the
  original at the controls, so nothing is owed on it and there is no scalar to put back. What stays
  TUNE is the `fly_trailN` anchor being invisible so that
  only the trail shows; and the DISTANCE interval hides behind an inverted flag
  (`has_interval_value` false, key off `interval_type`).

## Weapons & combat

## Flight model & collision physics

## Environment & world

- `BL-272` `[Tuning]` `[M]` `[Next: look]` `[Impact: low]` `[Evidence: footage]` **Precipitation: snow's unit mapping from `weather.json` to a look is invented
  and unjudged; rain reads like the original** (`Precipitation.cs:29-62`, type/tint/rate/density
  are authored; fall speed, box size, particle counts, streak length/width, sway are 16 TUNE
  constants; the sprites themselves are procedural stand-ins for the original's untextured
  line/point primitives, and rain streaking along fall-direction-vs-velocity is a documented
  remake-only rule). Rain reads like the original at the controls under C2B IA1's cloud cover,
  streak width included, so its constants stand. *Owed:* snow, flown against the original or its
  footage in a chapter that authors it; the snow constants are the ones still invented.
  ⚠ `CAP-11`'s C2B take shows the original's rain as one-pixel-wide streaks that the 2560-wide
  Game DVR capture swallows, so a capture of that size is no instrument for streak width.

## Effects & animation runtime

- `BL-537` `[Tuning]` `[Owed-playtest]` `[S]` `[Next: look]` `[Impact: low]` `[Evidence: feel]` **Effect pools at four players, judged in play.** The pool sizes in `CSVM/data/effect_pools.json` were re-judged on a build with no first-use construction cost: rockets and the sonic burst never wrap, a four-object simultaneous death wraps `flame_ball_01` at 4 and 6 slots and is quiet at 8 (now shipped), and seven or more identical deaths in one frame wrap at the 16 ceiling and cannot be sized away. At the controls the single-player half reads right: four fireballs burn out in place, and the seven-death wrap is not visible under the debris. Still owed: a 4-player splitscreen session with everyone firing, judged for anything that reads as shared between panes, and the ceiling for many-player builds (at 16 players the default root wants 19 and gets 16). The instrument is `AnimRuntime.PoolRecycles` and the `anim: effect pool for '<name>' recycled slot` DEBUG line in the log file sink; the sizes staged print on the world-effects build line. ⚠ Raise only a root that logs a recycle, never the default; the three gun roots stay at 1; a root sized 0 clamps to 1. Each slot copies the root's subtree (155 templates at 1 player, 263 at 4).
  *Cross-refs:* `PT-129` (the four-player flight that judges it), `BL-296` (the other splitscreen-scoped item).

## Audio

## Cameras & views

## HUD & UI


## Splitscreen

Our splitscreen mode (2–4 players) has no counterpart in the original, so every rule it authored
against "the player" or "the camera" needs an explicit splitscreen verdict: generalise it, take a
nearest/union rule, or record it as deliberately single/global. This theme collects that work
(sweep of 2026-08-15). **Route fixes through the two existing seams instead of minting new ones:**
`GameSession.PlayerPositions` (nearest human) for gameplay rules that say "the player", and the
viewer set behind `ProjectilePool.Viewers` / `ScreenSize.NearestFloor` for draw rules that say
"the camera". Sim state stays global, the mission wind is the worked example
(`Session/WeatherRig.Tick`, stepped once per frame outside the per-rig loop on purpose). Splitscreen-scoped items that live with
their own system: `BL-537` (the 4-player pool judgement), `BL-296` (per-player ActionMap),
`BL-314` (race countdown).

The theme's first batch (`BL-126`, `BL-365`–`BL-376`) landed via
`PLAN-splitscreen-polish` (2026-08-15,
complete, the chrome playtest F52/`BL-126` closed it out). New splitscreen findings mint here as
usual.

- `BL-389` `[Tuning]` `[S]` `[Next: look]` `[Impact: low]` `[Evidence: feel]` **Splitscreen weapon mix needs a retune: rockets too quiet, guns too loud,
  especially four guns firing at once.** Found at the `BL-126` chrome playtest (F52,
  2026-08-15), `FlightAudio.MixGain`/`Projectile.cs`'s pool `MixGain` (the `1/sqrt(N)` equal-power
  attenuation D31/D32 landed) reads right in isolation but the per-weapon balance under it does
  not: a 4-player Dogfight with simultaneous gunfire is too loud relative to rocket explosions,
  which read as too quiet against it. *Look for:* rocket vs. gun relative level across 2P/4P,
  specifically four guns firing together. *Fix shape:* a judgement call at the controls on the
  per-def volume terms feeding `Projectile.cs`'s `def.Volume * 0.2f * MixGain * distanceGain`
  (line ~2238), not the `1/sqrt(N)` splitscreen term itself, which is confirmed correct.

## Missions, modes & campaign

- `BL-314` `[Feature]` `[L]` `[Next: code]` `[Impact: high]` `[Evidence: feel]` **A time-attack stunt race, solo, split screen and network.**
  Scheduled as [`docs/PLAN-stunt-race.md`](docs/PLAN-stunt-race.md); the countdown shape and its four
  traps live in that plan's A2.

## Tooling, platform & docs

- `BL-033` `[Cleanup]` `[Blocked: SDL >= 3.4.4]` `[S]` `[Next: code]` `[Impact: none]` `[Evidence: data]` **Drop the `SDL_JOYSTICK_DIRECTINPUT=0` launch-script workaround** (set 2026-07-19 in
  RunGame.ps1/RunDev.ps1) once tools/godot ships a Godot bundling **SDL ≥ 3.4.4**. *Decision:*
  wait for that SDL; the variable stays in the launch scripts and out of the export until then,
  and the item lands with the Godot bump that carries the fix. The bundled
  SDL (3.2.28 up to Godot 4.7.1) hard-freezes the engine when a >255-button DirectInput device
  disconnects, the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 dongle's HID interface is one (`Uint8` loop counter vs
  uncapped dinput `nbuttons`; godot#115667, SDL#14961, fixed by SDL#15304). Check the bundled
  `thirdparty/sdl/joystick/SDL_joystick.c` `SDL_PrivateJoystickForceRecentering` for the `int i`
  fix before removing. Side effects while active: DirectInput-only controllers (non-XInput sticks
  without an SDL HIDAPI driver) are invisible in-game, and, since the var is set by the launch
  scripts and never by the export, a shipped build enumerates DirectInput devices that no dev or
  test run sees. An 8BitDo Ultimate 2 arrives as three joypads there, which is how a device that
  holds a roster position without producing input came to take the seat `AssignPads` fills by
  position; `Pads.LogPads` records the roster so the next one reads off the log rather than being
  inferred. Dropping the var also closes that divergence.

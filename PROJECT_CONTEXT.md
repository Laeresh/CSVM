# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

Tool-neutral project brief for CSVM. Any coding agent working in this repo should read this
file first — `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are thin, tool-specific pointers into it.

## ⚠ Keep the index files + `docs/` up to date

**This file is the compact, authoritative index of project context; deep detail lives in
`docs/`.** Update documentation in the same turn as the change it describes:

- Module purpose → the module's `## src/...` entry in `docs/architecture.md`. **That file orients a reader: what each module is for, what it owns, and which other module to look at next. Nothing else.** Body ≤ ~8 lines, ~12 for the heaviest. **`⚠` traps do not belong there.** A trap that constrains a future edit goes in the code, at the member it binds, under the comment caps below; a trap that is really format or decode knowledge goes in `docs/formats/` or `docs/org/`; a way a measurement misleads goes in `docs/verification.md`. **Read a module's entry there before modifying that module**, then read the code. Diagnosis narratives go in the landing commit's message body.
- A new, renamed or deleted module → **`docs/architecture.md` only**, updating its index line and its `##` entry in the same edit. This file carries the namespace map, never a per-module list; keeping both was 13 KB of duplication and had already drifted.
- Format / reverse-engineering knowledge → `docs/formats/`.
- The extraction pipeline, the launch scripts, or the mech3ax fork → `docs/tooling.md`.
- A way a MEASUREMENT can mislead (non-determinism, an instrument that manufactures its own answer, a masked effect) → `docs/verification.md`, as a transferable rule. A commit message alone buries it — nobody reads the log before starting work. Shape: a bold 1–2-line imperative + at most one sentence of measured evidence — no narrative.
- Landed work → the commit message body — what landed, how verified, outcome — plus tick the active plan's checklist and **swap** the "Current status" next-step pointer. The status section must be no longer after the landing edit than before it; the description of what landed lives in the commit and the plan, never here.
- Pure refactors with no external effect → usually no update needed. When in doubt, update.

- If a task is delegated to a subagent use cheaper models when appropriate. For example a cheaper/faster model tier for exploration.

**Budget and shape — this file is an index, not a narrative.** `CLAUDE.md` once grew to 162 KB because every session appended while nobody owned the total; three rules keep that from happening again:

- **Budget: this file stays under ~35 KB.** If a change would push it over, the content belongs in `docs/` and this file gets a *pointer* instead. Check with `(Get-Item PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).Length` before adding a paragraph, not after.
- **Shape: never restate a list another file already indexes — point at that file.** If a section here starts growing one line per *thing*, that list belongs in `docs/` with a pointer in its place.
- **"Current status" holds pointers and item IDs — never a description of landed work, in any tense.** The tripwire is size — over ~15 lines / ~2 KB means history crept in.

**Standing rule — AI-assistance disclosure (decided 2026-07-21).** Every outward-facing communication about this work discloses that it was done with the help of an AI coding agent: PR bodies, issues, discussion posts, comments, and any community writeup — not only an initial submission. Commits carry a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming the acting agent and model (e.g. `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`) — whichever agent actually did the work, not a fixed name. The user owns all upstream/community communication, so this is a constraint on what gets *drafted* for them, not an instruction to post anything.

## Project Description

An XWVM-style remake of **Crimson Skies** (2000, Zipper Interactive, Microsoft): a modern engine that plays the original game using the player's own legally-owned game files.

**Public home: <https://github.com/Laeresh/CSVM>** (`origin`, branch `main`). The repo is named **CSVM**; use that name in outward-facing text and as the CC-BY attribution target for `docs/formats/`.

## 🚫 Hard rule: no game assets in version control — ever

Public open-source project under the **XWVM legal model**: the repo ships **code and format documentation only**. Game files, extracted assets, ZBD contents, screenshots of hexdumps containing bulk asset data — none of it gets committed or published. The importer reads the player's own install at runtime. `.gitignore` enforces this for `CrimsonSkiesGame/`, `extracted/`, and `tools/`; keep it that way when adding directories.

**Licensing (decided 2026-07-22).** Code is **GPL-3.0-or-later** (root `LICENSE`); `docs/formats/` is **CC BY 4.0** (`docs/formats/LICENSE`) so the format knowledge is reusable by permissively-licensed projects. New code files need no per-file header — the root `LICENSE` plus the `README.md` notice covers the repo. The mech3ax fork is **EUPL-1.2** (upstream's license, not a choice) and is a separate tool, not linked into the engine; GPL-3.0 was chosen partly because the EUPL Appendix lists it as compatible, so fork code *could* later be vendored in. Do not relicense any part permissively without checking that chain. `README.md` also carries the not-affiliated-with-Microsoft disclaimer and the AI-assistance disclosure.

## Scratch / probe output

When generating temporary artifacts — probe images, screenshots, rendered
previews, debug dumps, golden-test captures, etc. — always write them into
`./.scratch/` inside this workspace. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.

- Do NOT write scratch output to the OS temp directory
  (e.g. AppData\Local\Temp\claude\...). Files there aren't reachable from
  VS Code's Explorer and clickable links to them don't resolve.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g. `probe_full.png`, `zbd_texture_dump_01.png`)
  rather than UUIDs, so they're easy to find in the sidebar.
- When you produce such a file, print its workspace-relative path
  (e.g. `./.scratch/probe_full.png`) so it can be opened directly.
- `./.scratch/` is a tmp folder. If anything needs to stay as evidence move it into `./analyis`

## Architecture & key decisions

- **Engine:** Godot 4 .NET (C#). Consumes mech3ax extraction output (JSON/zip) via its own readers in `CSVM/src/Mech3/` — no Mech3DotNet or other package dependency.
- **Format reverse engineering:** happens in a fork of [mech3ax](https://github.com/TerranMechworks/mech3ax) (Rust) at `tools/mech3ax/`. Their byte-identical round-trip test harness (extract→repack) is the correctness standard. **The CS work stays in the fork, not upstream** (upstream dropped CS for maintenance reasons and is dormant) — remotes, branch roles and the sync procedure are in `docs/tooling.md`.
- **Flight model:** data-driven approximation — parameterized by plane stats from extracted zrdr reader files, hand-tuned against the original game. No exe decompilation.
- **Division of labor:** the AI agent writes the Rust parsers, Godot code, and docs; the user reviews, playtests flight feel, and owns upstream/community communication.
- **Git: commit to `main`.** This is a single-developer repo with no PR workflow, so **do not create a branch** when asked to commit — commit straight to `main`. The user will say so explicitly if a particular change should go on its own branch. Pushing is still never automatic: commit when asked, push only when asked.

## Coding conventions
- Comments state what and why, briefly — never provenance (dates, plan/milestone/item references), never history, never instructions to a reviewer. If a comment's only content is where a change came from, it should not exist.
- **Use the terms in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md)**, and never a word that file lists under `_Avoid_`.
- **Comment length is capped, in `CSVM/src` and `CSVM.Tests`.** A comment block over its cap fails the commit; [`CheckCommentCaps.ps1`](CheckCommentCaps.ps1) is what the hook runs, and what you run yourself while editing.

  | comment | cap |
  |---|---|
  | `///` on a type | 12 lines |
  | `///` on a member | 6 lines |
  | `//` above a declaration | 6 lines |
  | `//` above a statement | 3 lines |

  Sentences are ≤ 25 words; a block is ≤ 6 sentences and covers one topic. A warning states the
  prohibition first and the reason second: `⚠ Do not remove the seen dedup; C1 and C4 still need it.`
- **What a comment holds depends on what it is attached to.** Above a statement, the code says the
  what, so the comment says only why. Above a `const`, field or member, the value itself is
  unrecoverable from the code, so the comment holds the binding rule and a pointer to the decode:
  `docs/org/<module>.md` or `docs/formats/<format>.md`.
- **Evidence lives in `docs/`, not in a comment.** Measurement tables, refuted hypotheses and how a
  value was arrived at go on the module's docs page. Before cutting a block, check that page
  actually covers the claim, and write it there in the same commit if it does not. The removed
  prose goes in the commit message body, as diagnosis narratives already do.
- **No XML doc on private members**, and no `<para>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<list>` or `<item>` anywhere:
  the build generates no documentation file (`.editorconfig` silences SA0001 for that reason), so
  they render for nobody. `<see cref>` and `<c>` stay; the IDE reads them.

## Repo layout

One line each — **the extraction pipeline, the launch scripts and the mech3ax fork are in `docs/tooling.md`**; none of it is needed to write engine code.

- `CSVM/` — the Godot 4 .NET project (the actual remake; committed). See "Godot project" below.
- `CSVM/shaders/` — shared `.gdshaderinc` blocks `#include`d by the generated shaders (instance-uniform order, sRGB, fog, lights, clock).
- `CSVM/data/` — **committed** hand-authored engine config (not extracted assets), loaded via `res://`. Holds `stock_loadouts.json` (the 11 planes' stock weapon fit; see `docs/formats/loadouts.md`) and `effect_pools.json` (per-root effect-template pool sizes; see `docs/architecture.md` on `EffectPools`).
- `CSVM.Tests/` — the xUnit project (`dotnet test`): reader units on hand-authored fixtures + `extracted/` golden counts, skipped when absent.
- `CrimsonSkiesGame/` — the user's retail install (git-ignored): ZBD archives in `CrimsonSkiesGame/ZBD/` as chapters `C1`–`C5`, each with `IA1` / `M0x` / `MP1`–`3`; cutscenes are plain MPGs in `CrimsonSkiesGame/GOSDATA/ASSETS/GRAPHICS/MPG/`.
- `extracted/` — extraction output workdir (git-ignored), mirroring the game's ZBD structure. Loaders prefer an unpacked sibling folder over its `.zip`. Layout + what is deliberately not loaded: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `ExtractAssets.ps1` — bulk ZBD extractor (`unzbd cs <mode>` per type, fork build, idempotent). Details: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `ExtractRof.ps1` — extractor for the non-ZBD half: the `.rof` UI archives + DLL string tables → `extracted/rof/`. Details: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `RunGame.ps1` / `RunDev.ps1` — play and dev launch scripts (build + Godot; dev one prompts). Details: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `RunTests.ps1` — one command, one exit code: build → `dotnet test` → `--run-tests` (`-Shards`, default 4) → goldens (`-GoldenWorkers`, default 4) → perf (`-Perf`, A/B'd via the git-ignored `perf-history.jsonl`) → hitch (`-Hitch`, opt-in and last). Details: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `ExportRelease.ps1` — builds, headless-imports, and exports the "Windows Desktop" release preset to `.scratch/export/CSVM.exe`; checks the export templates are installed and creates `.scratch/export/` if missing before starting. Details: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `RunProbe.ps1` — **every ad-hoc scripted Godot launch goes through this** (`--screenshot=`, `--dump-*`, one-off `--run-tests=`): hidden desktop + streams redirected to files, so nothing flashes on screen or prints over the calling terminal. Never invoke the Godot exe directly for a probe. Details: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `HiddenDesktop.ps1` — dot-sourced by `RunTests.ps1`: runs every launch on a separate Windows desktop so no test window ever appears on screen. Details: `docs/tooling.md`.
- `CleanScratch.ps1` — sweeps `.scratch/` artifacts **and finished `.claude/worktrees/` agent worktrees** (`-?` lists its switches). Spares backups and dirty worktrees; leaves branches alone by default.
- `CheckCommentCaps.ps1` — the comment-length caps above, over `CSVM/src` and `CSVM.Tests`. Bare for the file:line list, `-Summary` for one line per file worst-first, or with paths for just those files. Scans the worktree the script file itself lives in, not the caller's working directory, so it is correct from any worktree regardless of where it is invoked. A pre-commit hook runs it; run it yourself while editing.
- `New-ItemId.ps1` — mints the next `BL-`/`CAP-`/`PT-` item ID (`-Kind BL`, optional `-Count n` to reserve a block). The counter sits in `.git/item-id-counters.json` — shared by all worktrees, incremented under an exclusive lock — so concurrent sessions can't mint the same number. **Never assign an item ID any other way, and run it for EVERY id rather than once per session** — deriving the next id by adding 1 (or reusing one it handed you earlier) leaves the counter behind the file, so the invented number is handed out again on the next call. Use `-Count n` when you need several at once. A pre-commit hook fails the commit if `backlog.md`/`playtest.md` define an ID twice.
- `tools/` — downloaded binaries (git-ignored): pinned mech3ax v0.6.1, the mech3ax fork, the Godot 4.7 .NET editor.
- `analysis/` — **committed** read-only analysis scripts + their `FINDINGS.md`, one dir per question. For instruments whose result `docs/` cites, because `.scratch/` is swept. No game data in them, ever.
- `analysis/goldens/manifest.json` — the golden-image tripwire: 16 pinned `--det` shots as command line + raw-pixel md5. Hashes only, never pixels.
- `analysis/verification-budgets.json` — `RunTests.ps1`'s per-stage and total wall-time budgets, the measured distribution behind them, and the rule that set them. Awareness thresholds; they never change the exit code.
- `analysis/engine-suite-weights.json` — the measured per-suite engine weights the shard planner divides the catalog by, so one tree shards the same way every run.
- `docs/tooling.md` — the extraction pipeline, the launch scripts, and the fork's remotes/branches/sync procedure.
- `docs/architecture.md` — per-module purpose + still-binding constraints for `CSVM/src`, one `##` entry each. **Read a module's entry before changing it.**
- `docs/formats/` — the public reader-format reference, one page per format family; `README.md` is the index + shared reader conventions.
- `docs/cli.md` — the full per-flag CLI reference (this file keeps only the day-to-day table).
- `docs/verification.md` — how to verify a change here, and how the instruments lie. Read before measuring anything.
- `docs/HISTORY.md` — chronological development log 2026-07-14 → 2026-08-05, **frozen 2026-08-06: never append or edit**. Landed work since then is recorded in git commit messages (`git log`). Kept because live docs cite its dated entries and `New-ItemId.ps1` scans it for retired IDs.
- `docs/plans/` — completed plans, indexed in `plans.md` there; each banner-marked `COMPLETE`, kept for evidence and dead ends, read as history. **A plan sitting in `docs/` rather than in here is live** — see "Current status" for which is active.
- `backlog.md` — unscheduled work, ordered by theme (Damage & destruction, Weapons & combat, …): every item one flat `BL-NNN` bullet with a type tag (`[Bug]`/`[Feature]`/`[Research]`/`[Tuning]`/`[Cleanup]`) and an optional status tag (`[Owed-playtest]`, `[Blocked: <blocker>]`). The TUNE list is the set of items tagged `[Tuning]`. Move items into a plan when scheduled; **delete when landed — a `FIXED`/closed entry does not stay here.** Its record belongs in the landing commit's message; its traps in `docs/verification.md` or `docs/architecture.md`. **If closing it leaves follow-up work, that follow-up becomes its own new entry with a `⚠ Traps` section** naming the rejected fixes and the misleading instruments — an open thread buried inside a section headed `FIXED` is invisible to anyone scanning for work.
- `playtest.md` — the at-the-controls checklist, holding **only what is actionable today** (`PT-nn`) plus one consolidated list of owed captures of the original (`CAP-nn`), each naming the `BL-` it unblocks. IDs are permanent and cited like `BL-nnn`. A test blocked on an unlanded fix does not live here — it rides its `backlog.md` entry as a `*Playtest after fix:*` line and comes back when the fix does. Deep evidence stays in `backlog.md`; keep the two in step.
- `playtest/` — captures staged for a `playtest.md` item, one subfolder per ID (`playtest/PT-03/`). Git-ignored, and unlike `.scratch/` **not swept by `CleanScratch.ps1`** — they survive until the item closes, then the folder goes with it.
- `OriginalScreenshots/` — user-captured reference shots + videos from the original game (git-ignored). `docs/` cites these by filename as evidence, so those citations resolve only in the user's local tree — **ask the user if a referenced capture is missing.**

### Development verification loop

- **During an edit, run the smallest red/green surface.** For one engine suite use
  `.\RunTests.ps1 -Suite <suite> -SkipUnits -SkipGoldens` (exact name; `-Filter` is still the
  substring form); for a unit use
  `dotnet test CSVM.Tests/CSVM.Tests.csproj --no-build --filter "FullyQualifiedName~<test>"`, or
  `.\RunTests.ps1 -UnitFilter "FullyQualifiedName~<test>" -SkipEngine -SkipGoldens` for the same
  filter with the summary block. Both loops measure about 3 seconds warm. The hitch check is opt-in
  (`-Hitch`), so nothing has to be passed to keep it out of them.
- **Broad development confidence is `.\RunTests.ps1 -Quick`:** build, the checked-in quick unit
  tier and quick engine tier, no goldens and no hitch, with every omitted surface printed as a
  `not checked:` line. A selector or filter matching nothing fails its stage rather than passing
  empty.
- **Before landing any change under `CSVM/`, run the complete `.\RunTests.ps1`.** Targeted and quick
  runs are partial by design and never satisfy that landing gate. `CSVM.Tests/`-only,
  documentation, and tooling changes do not require the full run.
- **Every stage prints its wall time against a budget from `analysis/verification-budgets.json`.**
  An `over budget` marker is awareness only and never changes the exit code, because a busy
  workstation must not fail correct code; `docs/tooling.md` holds the rule that set the numbers.

## Godot project (`CSVM/`)

Godot 4.7 .NET, C# / net8.0. Build & run:

```
dotnet build CSVM/CSVM.sln
GODOT --path CSVM res://scenes/Main.tscn -- --plane=player_bhawk
```

(First time only: run with `--headless --import` once before running scenes.)

**Module map — the per-module index lives in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md), which now opens with it.** Find the module in that index, then read only its `##` entry: `Grep "## src/Flight/FlightModel.cs" -A 12` returns the whole entry. **Never read architecture.md whole** — it is ~110 KB. Read a module's entry before changing it.

- `src/Mech3/` (40) — extraction readers, the GameZ→Godot builders, and the animation runtime: install → live world.
- `src/Flight/` (34) — the aircraft as a flying, shooting, damageable thing, plus its HUD and stunt mode.
- `src/Effects/` (4) — particle systems: puffers, the ambient cloud field, precipitation, the world wind.
- `src/UI/` (16) — launchscreen, splitscreen rig, and the inspection labs (each with a scripted `--debug-*` twin).
- `src/Utils/` (6) — session-wide services: clock, log, seed, shader time, config, startup profile. Determinism lives here.
- `src/Testing/` (6) — the in-engine assertion harness behind `--run-tests` and the `--dump-*` probes.
- `src/Session/` (11) — `Launcher.cs` (Main.tscn root: bootstrap, launchscreen, persistent camera/lighting) and `GameSession.cs` (the per-launch session node it instantiates), plus livery/spawn/plane-roster resolution, the roster aggregate with grouped inputs and its two internal assemblers, the effect/crash stage factory, and the weather rig.
- `src/` root (3) — `SessionSpec.cs`, `SessionPaths.cs`, `Pads.cs`.
- `CSVM.Tests/` — the xUnit project: engine-free reader units. Anything reaching `GD.*` or a live `Node` belongs in `src/Testing/` instead.

Highest-traffic modules, so the common cases skip the index: `GameSession.cs` (session build), `FlightController.cs` (the flying node), `FlightModel.cs` (physics), `SceneBuilder.cs` (every mesh), `WorldBuilder.cs` (chapter worlds), `AnimRuntime.cs` (world animation), `Projectile.cs` (weapon fire), `Suites.cs` (golden counts).

### User args (after `--`)

**Flight is the default.** Any content arg builds a *flight* unless `--viewer` is present: `--plane=player_fury` flies the Fury and `--chapter=C4` flies over C4. `--viewer` gives the static inspection view, where the livery / mesh labs live. The damage lab now lives in both — F5 in `--viewer` drives a parked plane's visuals, F5 in `--fly` drives the flown plane's real HP — so `--fly` is redundant except with `--damage=`, which picks the parked viewer unless flight was asked for by name. A bare launch (no content arg) shows the launchscreen.

The day-to-day 29 of 138 — 138 is both the parser's accepted-flag count and `docs/cli.md`'s flag-index count, kept equal on purpose. **[`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) opens with an index of all of them, grouped**, and each flag's bullet there is the **description of record** — the whole `--debug-*` family, the paint overrides, spawn/mission selection, scripted `--hold` input, the data-path overrides, and the deprecated `--campos`/`--spawn-at`/`--spawn-dir` spellings of the placement pair.

⚠ **These rows are glosses, not the spec: a behaviour change edits the `cli.md` bullet, and a row here only when the gloss went wrong.**  Adding a row is rarely right — the index is one file away.

| Flag | Does |
|---|---|
| `--chapter[=C1]` | which chapter world (`C1`/`C1B`/`C1C`/`C2`/`C2B`/`C3`/`C4`/`C5`); flown by default |
| `--stage=empty` | no *chapter* gamez: a collidable grid ground plane + the plane, booting in ~2 s — the flight/ballistics test stage |
| `--node=<cs_name>` | `--viewer`/`--anim-lab` build only that gamez subtree, auto-framed; multiple matches build the first, a miss lists candidates |
| `--plane=` | which aircraft; comma-separated gives one per splitscreen player |
| `--fly` | free flight (the default): world + skydome + plane + arcade controls; also hosts the damage lab (F5) on the flown plane |
| `--stunt` | flight + the mission's Danger Zones as timed fly-through objectives; a race with `--players` |
| `--vs` | "Dogfight": splitscreen free-for-all deathmatch on the `dogfight_ace` spawns; beats `--stunt` by fixed precedence |
| `--viewer` | the static inspection view; hosts the damage (F5), livery (L) and mesh (M) labs |
| `--freecam` | spectator mode: the live animated world, no aircraft, free-flying camera, click-selection |
| `--anim-lab` | the animation debugger: quiet world stage + def playback (`--play-anim=`, `--seed=`) on a fixed-dt clock; a transport button panel, the freecam camera, and click-to-follow the selection |
| `--players=N` | splitscreen 1–4 in one shared world, one pane/camera/HUD/pad each |
| `--pos=x,y,z` | place the mode's **subject**: the camera in `--freecam`/`--viewer`/`--anim-lab`, the plane in `--fly`/`--stunt` (bypassing the mission spawn list) |
| `--direction=x,y,z` | which way it faces there — view direction or nose. `--lookat=x,y,z` is the point form (and the `--viewer` orbit pivot). Quote comma args in PowerShell |
| `--view=1-9` | hold a numpad flight-camera perspective for the run (2 belly, 4/6 flanks, 8 ahead); `--fly`/`--stunt` only. Distance is the shared dynamic chase radius; the layout is disputed (`BL-150`) — [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) |
| `--screenshot=<path>` | render a few frames, save PNG, quit — the automated-verification workhorse |
| `--frames=N` / `--shots=N` | which sim frame the shot lands on (default 15) — **a sim coordinate, not a wall-clock delay** / capture N consecutive frames |
| `--debug-anim` | log every live animation's pose and sound emitters once a second; conditions only when a verdict **flips** (a repeat line means a change) |
| `--perf` | log the frame-cost/draw-count split every 60 frames (the headless profiler stand-in) |
| `--run-tests[=filter]` | run the in-engine assertion suites, print the PASS/FAIL/SKIP table + `.scratch/test-report.json`, **exit nonzero on any failure** |
| `--log=` | console log filter, `cat[:level],…` over `anim`/`world`/`flight`/`weapons`/`sound`/`perf`/`test`/`ui`/`core`; every run always writes **everything** to `.scratch/logs/` regardless |
| `--det` | the determinism bundle: fixed-dt sim clock + master seed 1 + `--spawn=0` + pinned liveries + `--no-pads` + `--jitter=0`; **implied by every flag that drives and ends a session by itself** — `--screenshot=`, the `--dump-*` reports, `--damage-test`, `--effects-test`, `--weapon-test`, `--run-tests` — and announced as a `det …` log line |
| `--no-det` | opt back out — wall-clock sim and live randomness, **beating both the implication and an explicit `--det`** (`--det --no-det` runs on the wall clock) |
| `--seed=N` | the master seed every subsystem RNG derives from (spread, crash sound, spawn, liveries, anim dice, particles); pinned to 1 by `--det` |
| `--tex-override=<name>[=<color>]` | the named texture resolves flat magenta (or your colour) everywhere it is used — "is this thing drawing at all?" |
| `--tex-census[=names]` | every texture resolves to its own flat colour; map to `.scratch/tex_census.json`, per-texture pixel counts for a `--screenshot` beside it. **Pair with `--no-fog`**; counts are lower bounds — see [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) |
| `--collision[=show]` | build the world's colliders in a mode that builds none (freecam/anim-lab/viewer); `=show` opens the **C** wireframe overlay — but only in freecam/anim-lab, since C in `--viewer` is the mesh lab's cull cycler |
| `--no-pads` | ignore every gamepad — a drifting stick silently ruins a scripted run |
| `--mute` | skip flight audio — a **load-time** switch, so nothing plays *and nothing is counted or logged*; a muted baseline is blind to sound errors |
| `--volume=N` | master gain 0–1 (default 0 since 2026-08-05 — `RunGame.ps1`/`RunDev.ps1` pass `--volume=1.0` so interactive play sounds). `--volume=0` is silent but **not** blind: audio still loads, plays, counts and logs, so a run is testable from `.scratch/logs/`. Also the `audio.volume` config key, which the flag beats |

the player controls during development are in `docs/controls.md`. **change them if the player input changes**

### Format gotchas

**The cross-cutting gotchas that bite constantly live in [`docs/formats/gotchas.md`](docs/formats/gotchas.md)** —  **Read it before writing any reader, transform, or shader code.**

**Never work out which campaign mission `CM17` is: [`docs/formats/campaign-missions.md`](docs/formats/campaign-missions.md) is the `CM01`-`CM24` ↔ `C<n>/M0<n>` ↔ `seq` lookup, both directions.**

Full validated format documentation lives in **`docs/formats/`** — one page per format family. **`README.md` there is the index + the shared reader conventions; start there** rather than duplicating its table here. **Rule: new decodes land with their docs page in the same change.**

## Agent skills

Config the installed engineering skills read. Written by `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`; edit the files directly. The skills live at `.claude/skills/`, mirrored at `.agents/skills/` (a local junction — see `AGENTS.md`) so agents that follow the `.agents/` convention find the same set.

## Current status / next step

**Fixed shape — five short paragraphs, ~15 lines / ~2 KB: this rule, where the project is, active plan + wave position, next items, pointers.** When work lands, the only edits allowed here are: advance the wave-position clause, swap the "Next" IDs, delete text. **Adding a sentence about the landed item is forbidden in every tense** —  If this section is longer after your edit than before it, the edit was wrong.

**Where the project is.** Milestones 1 through 5 are delivered (plans indexed in [`docs/plans/plans.md`](docs/plans/plans.md)): 11 flyable aircraft over 8 animated chapter worlds, launched from the in-game menu, with original liveries, weather, world animation and sound; extraction is complete and round-trips byte-identically. M3 added guns, rockets and world destructibles that take damage, die, lose collision, throw debris and reset; M4 added the combat AI (aircraft that patrol, engage, evade and die, turrets, zeppelins, pilot voice), and all four Instant Action mission types plus the 2–4-player splitscreen Dogfight deathmatch are playable and scored. M5 added the single-player campaign: per-profile progression across the cabin, briefing and flight-check screens, and missions that run their authored `objectives.zrd` choreography with intro cutscenes, letterbox and campaign wingmen.

**Active plans:** [`docs/PLAN-M5-polish-5.md`](docs/PLAN-M5-polish-5.md), every item landed and verified on the plan branch, and [`docs/PLAN-M5-polish-6.md`](docs/PLAN-M5-polish-6.md), all eleven items resolved on `worktree-m5-polish-6`; [`docs/PLAN-scrapbook.md`](docs/PLAN-scrapbook.md) has Wave A (`A1`-`A3`), Wave B (`B11`-`B14`) and Wave C's `C15`-`C16` landed on `worktree-bl-622-debrief-decode`.
Next: `D31`, the CM04 to CM09 (plus CM13) sortie at the controls, then close run 5; run 6's two partials are `B11` (`BL-546`) and `B13` (`BL-535`); the scrapbook's Wave C continues with `C17`.
`PT-84`, `PT-85`, `PT-88` and `BL-120`/`PT-53` remain owed playtests.

Use the targeted/quick development loop above, then verify landed code with the complete
**`.\RunTests.ps1`**; read [`docs/verification.md`](docs/verification.md) before measuring.

The owed at-the-controls playtests are in [`playtest.md`](playtest.md).

Everything else unscheduled — known issues, deferred items, fidelity questions, the TUNE list — is in `backlog.md`; keep it updated as items land or get scheduled.

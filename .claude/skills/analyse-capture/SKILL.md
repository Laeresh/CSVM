description: Analyse an owed capture (CAP-nn) — find its videos and screenshots, watch them, and answer the backlog items it was filmed to unblock. Use when the user names a CAP-NN, hands over new footage of the original game, or asks what a capture shows.
---

Turn one `CAP-nn` recording of **the original game** into evidence a `backlog.md` item can close on.

The capture exists because a question could not be answered from extracted data or from our own
build — so the whole value is in reading the footage honestly. This skill is **watch-and-describe**;
it edits `backlog.md`/`playtest.md` only at the end, and never commits unless asked.

⚠ **Never answer from the filename or from the backlog's expectation of what the clip shows.**
Every claim must cite a timestamp or a frame number you actually produced. If the footage does not
show the thing, the finding is "the clip does not settle this" — which is a real result and must be
reported as one.

⚠ **A capture answers what something LOOKS or SOUNDS like, never what a number is.** A quantity read
off the cockpit panel or measured between two frames does not settle a flight constant: footage
cannot confirm a decode, it only ranks readings, and it will happily rank one nobody has thought of
(`docs/verification.md` DET-12; DET-11 on the sim clock that makes every wall-clock rate wrong by
39 %). Numbers come out of `crimson.exe` — see `docs/org/flightModel.md`. The gauge-decode pipeline this skill once
carried was retired for exactly this reason; do not rebuild it, and do not quote a figure from the
`videodata/` sidecars it left behind. If a capture's question turns out to be numeric, say so and
send it to a decode instead of measuring frames.

## 0. Work in a worktree

Enter a git worktree with `EnterWorktree` before touching anything else — name it after the
capture (e.g. `worktree-cap-08`). The skill edits `backlog.md` and `playtest.md`
and can span several sessions, so isolating the work keeps `main` clean and lets
other captures run in parallel. Exit with `action: "keep"` when you report (Section 6), so the user
can review and merge the branch themselves — never merge or push it yourself.

## 1. Resolve the capture

Argument may be `CAP-16`, a bare `16`, or a phrase like "the crash one".

Read the `CAP-nn` row in [`playtest.md`](playtest.md) §0 — it gives the capture's **purpose**, what
must be in frame, and the `BL-NNN`s it unblocks. Then read each of those backlog entries in full,
including the enclosing section heading. They carry the traps, the competing hypotheses, and the
specific thing to look for; going to the footage without them produces a description instead of an
answer.

A missing `CAP-nn` means the item closed and its ID retired (IDs are never reused) — say so rather
than guessing at a neighbour. A phrase means **ask which**, never guess.

## 2. Find the media — the naming is not regular

Search `OriginalScreenshots/` and `OriginalScreenshots/Videos/`, plus `playtest/<ID>/` for anything
already staged. Four traps, all of them live in the current file set:

- **The separator varies.** `CAP-14 Graze and CAP 15 wing to red.mp4` writes one ID hyphenated and
  the other spaced. Match `CAP[-_ ]?0*<n>` case-insensitively, not `CAP-<n>`.
- **One file can carry several captures.** That same clip is the whole of `CAP-15`. A file named for
  a neighbour is not evidence of absence — grep the *other* IDs too before reporting one missing.
- **Multiple takes are normal and are not ranked.** `CAP-05` has four files (two knife-edge, two
  stalls). Analyse all of them; if they disagree, that disagreement is the finding.
- **Screenshots are named by subject, not by ID.** No image in `OriginalScreenshots/` carries a
  `CAP` number today — they read `C1 IA1 Cloud Puffs and Moon.png`. So also search by the row's
  subject words (`cloud`, `flare`, `spawn`), and by chapter/mission prefix.

List what you found with durations and resolutions before analysing, so the user can correct the
set early. Say plainly if nothing matches.

⚠ Git-ignored media is absent from your worktree by design. Read it by absolute path
(`Z:\CSVM\OriginalScreenshots\...`), and **never** create a junction or symlink into the main
checkout — CLAUDE.md forbids it, and a stray link turns a later recursive delete into a deletion of
irreplaceable original-game footage.

## 3. Watch it

`ffmpeg` is not on `PATH`; the bundled binary is:

```
FF=$(python -c "import imageio_ffmpeg;print(imageio_ffmpeg.get_ffmpeg_exe())")
```

⚠ **Crop the pillarbox before anything else on a 32:9 clip**, or half the width of every tile and
still is black. `ffprobe` the size first: **2560×720** needs `crop=1280:720:640:0`; **2560×1440** is
already full-frame and needs no crop.

⚠ **Images are the single largest cost of a capture session** — a measured run spent most of its
context on ~20 sheets and stills, many at 2304×2160 or larger, and context once spent cannot be
recovered. Every sheet must be justified by a question it alone can answer.

- **Contact sheet first**, to find the interesting second:
  `"$FF" -i "<clip>" -vf "crop=1280:720:640:0,fps=1,scale=420:-1,tile=5x3" -frames:v 1 sheet.png`
  (drop the `crop` for a 16:9 clip; raise `fps` and the tile count for a short, fast event).
  Scale it down and keep the tile count low — a sheet you can read at 420 px wide costs a fraction
  of a full-res one and answers the same "which second" question.
- **Stills at a moment**, high quality: `"$FF" -ss <t> -i "<clip>" -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 out.png`
  (put `-ss` *before* `-i` for speed, after it for exact-frame accuracy).
- **Audio**: `"$FF" -i "<clip>" -vn -ac 1 -ar 22050 out.wav`, then analyse the spectrum in numpy —
  for a pitch question, track the fundamental over time rather than describing the sound.
- **Read the stills you produce.** Actually open them with Read; do not infer from the command
  succeeding.
- **Ask the user for a timestamp before surveying.** They flew it and know where the event is; a
  34 s clip may contain one 2 s stall break.

Write intermediates to the scratchpad, not the repo. Anything worth keeping for the user goes in
`playtest/<ID>/`, which is git-ignored and **not** swept, so it survives until the item closes.

For an A/B against our build, launch it with `./RunGame.ps1 --plane=… --chapter=…` (flags in
`docs/cli.md`) and frame the shot the same way — a comparison at a different angle or altitude is
not a comparison.

## 4. Ask, rather than guess — this is expected, not a failure

Batch questions with `AskUserQuestion` and keep working on the parts that don't depend on the
answer. Ask when:

- **You need a timestamp.** As above — ask "which second is the graze?" rather than sampling 34
  frames hoping.
- **The footage is ambiguous.** Two takes disagree, the gauge is unreadable at that scale, the
  effect is off-screen or behind the wing, the HUD element you need is occluded.
- **You cannot tell what you're looking at.** Which plane, which mission, which of several similar
  passes, whether a visual is the effect under test or an unrelated one.
- **The clip may not answer the question at all.** Say what is missing and what a re-record would
  need to include — that is more useful than a hedged verdict, and `playtest.md`'s row already
  states what must be in frame.

Offer your reading as the first option when you have one, and say what you'd conclude if they
haven't a preference. Do not stack up questions you could answer by looking harder.

## 5. Record the finding

Write to the entry that owns the question, in its own voice:

- **Answers a `BL-NNN`** → update the entry with what the footage shows and where, then
  offer `/close-backlog-item` rather than closing it here.
- **Refines it** → edit the entry so the next reader gets the sharper question, and note which
  hypothesis the footage rules out.
- **Settles nothing** → say so on the entry and in `playtest.md`'s row, with what a usable re-record
  needs. Do not silently leave the row looking discharged.
- **Discharges the capture** → the `CAP-nn` row goes only when every `BL-NNN` in its Unblocks column
  is served. If it still owes another item, leave the row and note what's done. When an ID does
  retire, it is never reused — take new IDs from `New-ItemId.ps1 -Kind CAP`, never by scanning
  `playtest.md` for a free one.
- Findings that change what we believe about the original are recorded in the closing commit's
  message, per `/close-backlog-item` §4.

⚠ **A capture is evidence about appearance, not proof of a constant.** Record the honest limit: one
take is not a distribution, a plateau is worth more than a transient, and what a single frame shows
carries that frame's noise. A consistency check that is fed the value it is meant to test will
confirm it — re-read `docs/verification.md`'s METHOD section before declaring a match.

## 6. Report

Before reporting, re-read the capture's `CAP-nn` row in `playtest.md` §0 and check it against what
you actually found. If the row still carries prose describing the shot as owed, unanalysed, or
open — and Section 5 discharged it or moved every open question onto the `BL-NNN` entries — that
prose is stale and must be updated or removed so the row doesn't contradict the backlog it points
to. Do not silently leave a discharged row reading as if the capture is still needed.

Give the user: which files were analysed, the finding per `BL-NNN` in plain prose with its evidence
cited by timestamp or frame, what remains open, and the files touched. Quote real observations and
real command output — never a summary of what a run "should" produce.

Then stop. **Do not commit** unless asked; offer it in one line. If you entered a worktree, leave it
in place (`keep`) — mention its path and branch so the user can review and merge it.

.SYNOPSIS
    The pre-release Linux check: the built tarball unpacked in WSL, extracted from the author's
    install with the exported build's own --extract, then the in-engine suites run headless from
    that export against that extraction. Any failure fails the check.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Linux sibling of sandbox\PublicRelease.ps1. That driver runs a zip inside Windows Sandbox;
    this one runs on the host and drives WSL (Debian), because a Linux tarball needs a Linux
    machine and WSL's Vulkan is too weak to render, so everything here is --headless.

    Stages, each reported PASS/FAIL in RunTests.ps1's style:
      payload      the archive's listing against packaging/MANIFEST.md's Linux table: every row
                   present, nothing at the root the table does not name, CSVM.x86_64 and
                   tools/unzbd marked -rwxr-xr-x, and LICENSE-thirdparty.txt stamped for the
                   linux-x64 runtime pack and the musl crate tree, naming nothing of Windows',
                   and no top-level text file (one without a NUL byte) carrying a CR
      extract      ./CSVM.x86_64 --headless -- --extract=<install> into a fresh data root, the
                   player's defaults (zips only): exit 0 and a stamped VERSION.json
      engine       (unless -NoSuites) --run-tests over that same zips-only data root, the shape
                   every player's install reads, in -Shards processes,
                   split by the harness's own shard:<i>/<n> term over
                   analysis/engine-suite-weights.json, so the suite list is the registry's and
                   never a copy of it; on the safe render thread (see the shard launch)

    A stage that fails does not stop the ones after it that can still run: a tarball whose unzbd
    lost its bit fails the payload stage AND shows what the extraction does with it.

    Everything in the distro lives under ~/csvm-linux-check (wiped at the start of each run, left
    behind for inspection), with XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_CACHE_HOME pointed into it,
    one set per process, so the distro user's ~/.local/share/godot is never touched and parallel
    shards share no user:// state. The run's listing, logs and reports are copied to
    .scratch\linux-check\<timestamp>\.

.PARAMETER Tarball
    The tarball to check. Default: .scratch\CSVM-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz, the name
    ExportRelease.ps1 -Linux gives it, the version read from CSVM/project.godot.

.PARAMETER Install
    The original game's installed folder (Windows path). Default: CrimsonSkiesGame\ under this
    tree, or under the tree CSVM_DATA_ROOT names when this one has none (a worktree).

.PARAMETER Shards
    Concurrent engine processes. Default 6, RunTests.ps1's measured default for a full run.

.PARAMETER NoSuites
    Stop after the payload and extraction stages: the release check proper, without the engine
    suites.

.PARAMETER ShardTimeoutSec
    Per-process watchdog, in seconds. Default 900.

.EXAMPLE
    .\sandbox\LinuxRelease.ps1
    The tarball ExportRelease.ps1 -Linux just built, extracted and tested in WSL.

.EXAMPLE
    .\sandbox\LinuxRelease.ps1 -Tarball Z:\somewhere\CSVM-v0.2.0-linux-x64.tar.gz -NoSuites

# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

Layout: **single-context**, one project, one shared vocabulary, no per-package split.

## Before exploring, read these

All binding:

- **`CONTEXT.md`**, the domain-terminology glossary: the term this project has fixed for a
  concept, and the words to avoid for it. Distinct from the project brief below. Read it before
  naming a domain concept in any output. `docs/adr/` does not exist and is not used; decisions
  live where "Flag decision conflicts" below says they do.
- **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`**, the compact authoritative project brief: charter, hard rules,
  module index, CLI flags, current status. `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` are thin, tool-specific
  pointers into it, read whichever of those your tool uses, then this file.
- **`docs/architecture.md`**, the routing index into `docs/architecture/<Namespace>.md`, where
  each module's purpose, what it owns and what to read next live, one `##` entry per `CSVM/src`
  module (a still-binding constraint sits as a comment on the member it binds, not there).
  **Read a module's entry before changing it**, find the module's namespace in the index, then
  `Grep "## src/<path>" -A 12 docs/architecture/`.
- **`docs/formats/`**, the validated reverse-engineered format reference;
  `gotchas.md` is the cross-cutting one, read before any reader/transform/shader work.
- **`docs/verification.md`**, how to verify a change, and how the instruments lie.
  Read before measuring anything.
- **git history**, decision record. Commit messages carry what landed and how it was
  verified; completed plans (deleted from the tree, read back with the commands in
  `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`'s repo layout) keep their dead ends, and the archived development
  log holds the earlier dated entries.

## Use the project's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in a backlog entry, a refactor proposal,
a hypothesis, a test name, a code comment), use the term as the project already
uses it. The vocabulary has three authorities, and all three bind:

- **`CONTEXT.md`**, the terms this project has explicitly fixed, each with the
  words to avoid for it. Where it has an entry, it decides. Add a term there when
  one gets resolved; `/domain-modeling` does this lazily, never speculatively.
- **The original game's own names**, `cs_name` node names, `zrdr` reader keys,
  `PUFFER_STATE` / `LIGHT_STATE` / `SOUND_NODE` and the rest of the anim-def
  vocabulary, chapter IDs `C1`–`C5`. These come from the shipped data. Never
  rename them to something tidier; the extraction and the docs both key off them.
- **The engine's own terms**, as fixed by the module index in `docs/architecture.md` and the
  module entries in `docs/architecture/<Namespace>.md` (destructible pool, gun group, hardpoint,
  pylon, firepoint, livery/paint scheme, danger zone, chapter world).

If the concept you need has no established term, that's a signal, either you're
inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap
(note it for `/domain-modeling`, which adds it to `CONTEXT.md`).

Comment length and shape are capped; see `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`'s coding conventions.

## Flag decision conflicts

Decisions here live in commit messages, `⚠` constraint lines in module entries in
`docs/architecture/<Namespace>.md`, rules in `docs/verification.md`, and the completed plans in git
history (which deliberately keep their dead ends). If your output
contradicts one, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts the `⚠` constraint on `src/Mech3/SceneBuilder.cs`, but worth reopening because…_

A rejected approach recorded in an archived plan is evidence, not a suggestion:
check *why* it was rejected before proposing it again.

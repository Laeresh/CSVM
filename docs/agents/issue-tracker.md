# Issue tracker: GitHub Issues

Issues for this repo live in GitHub Issues on `Laeresh/CSVM`. Use the `gh` CLI for all
operations; it infers the repo from `git remote -v` inside a clone.

New work goes there, internal and public alike. The committed markdown files below are the
record of what was filed before the switch, and stay only until each entry closes.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body-file <file>`. Write the body to a
  file first; shell quoting of a multi-line body goes wrong in both PowerShell and Bash here,
  the same reason commit messages use `git commit -F`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, plus `--json labels` when the state
  matters.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'`
  with `--label` and `--state` filters as needed.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body-file <file>`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

## Category labels

Three labels replace the three private id prefixes for anything filed from now on:

| Label | Replaces | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `backlog` | `BL-nnn` | **Unscheduled engine work.** Blocked/deferred items, feature backlog, open fidelity questions, TUNE entries. The default for a new issue. |
| `playtest` | `PT-nn` | **An owed at-the-controls check**: what to look for, the launch command, what it blocks. |
| `capture` | `CAP-nn` | **An owed capture of the original game**, naming the `backlog` issue it unblocks. |

An issue is cited by its number, `#123`, in commits, plans and other issues. The
`⚠ Traps` section a `backlog.md` entry carried (rejected fixes, misleading instruments) goes
in the issue body under the same heading. A public bug report from the form carries `bug`
and none of these three; it is worked in its own thread as before.

## Scheduling

`docs/PLAN-<name>.md` is still the live plan, a checklist of scheduled work with at most one
existing at a time, deleted in its closing commit and read back from git. A checklist item
that came from an issue cites the issue number. Scaffold one with `/new-plan`.

## The entries filed before the switch

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `backlog.md` | The `BL-` entries still open. Closing one deletes it, as `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` requires. No new entry is added. |
| `playtest.md` | The `PT-` and `CAP-` entries still open. Same rule. |

Do not migrate these in bulk; an entry moves to an issue only when it is reshaped or
scheduled anyway, and then the `backlog.md` entry is deleted in the same commit and the
issue body says which id it was. `New-ItemId.ps1` and `CheckItemIds.ps1` keep guarding the
old ids until the files are empty.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue with the fitting category label. If closing an issue would leave
follow-up work, that follow-up becomes its own issue with a `⚠ Traps` section, never a
comment on the closed one.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`. If the user names a `BL-`/`PT-`/`CAP-` id instead,
read that section of `backlog.md` or `playtest.md`, or the checklist item in the live
`docs/PLAN-*.md`.

## When work lands, the close-out is not optional

`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` binds these, and they apply to skill output too:

- Close the issue (or delete the `backlog.md` entry) in the landing commit; a fixed item
  does not stay open.
- Record in the landing commit's message body: what landed, how verified, outcome, and the
  issue number so `git log --grep='#123'` finds it. There is no history file to append to.
- Tick the live plan's checklist and **swap** the "Current status" next-step pointer in
  `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`; that section may only get shorter, never longer.
- A way a *measurement* can mislead → a transferable rule in `docs/verification.md`.
- A still-binding module constraint → a comment on the member it binds (prohibition first,
  reason second); format or decode knowledge → `docs/formats/` or `docs/org/`. Not the
  architecture entry.

## Triage state

Apply the label strings in `triage-labels.md` to the issue. A `backlog.md` entry that has not
moved yet records its role inline as a `Status: <role>` line.

## Public reports

Issues are the only public surface: Discussions are off, blank issues are on so a question
has somewhere to go, and the policy a reporter reads is in `.github/`.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` | The bug form. It requires the build version, the log file, the extraction state and the graphics driver, so a report can be identified without a round trip. |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` | Blank issues on, and the private security-advisory link. |
| `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` | What happens to a report, and what a pull request may touch. |
| `.github/SECURITY.md` | Scope, and the private reporting channel. |

A public report is worked in its own issue and is not copied into a `backlog` issue; the
thread is its whole record, which is the promise `CONTRIBUTING.md` makes. Internal issues
may reference a public one by number when a fix covers both. The internal issues are
public too now, so their bodies are written for a reader who did not run the session: no
session-only shorthand, no user-only recall stated as fact without saying so.

## PRs as a request surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature
requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

Small self-contained pull requests are accepted for `packaging/`, the extraction scripts,
documentation and typo fixes; anything under `CSVM/src` needs an issue first, because a
contributor cannot run `RunTests.ps1`'s golden tier against a retail install. The author's
own commits still go straight to `main`, so there is no internal PR queue.
`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` is what a contributor reads.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either;
resolve with `gh issue view 42` and fall back to `gh pr view 42`.

# Tooling, the extraction pipeline, the launch scripts, and the fork

How game files become `extracted/`, how the game gets launched, and how the mech3ax fork is
maintained. For *which* archive types extract and how far each is validated, see
[extraction](formats/extraction.md); for the engine's own flags, [cli.md](cli.md).

## `extracted/`, the extraction workdir (git-ignored)

Populated by `ExtractAssets.ps1`, mirroring the game's own ZBD folder structure: top-level
`planes.zip` (unzbd of `planes.zbd`), `zrdr.zip`, `soundsh.zip`/`soundsl.zip`, `interp.json`,
`rimage.zip`, plus per-chapter `C1/gamez.zip`, `C1/texture.zip`, `C1/rtexture*.zip`, `C1/zrdr.zip`,
and per-mission `C1/IA1/zrdr.zip`.

The viewer's defaults read `planes.zip`, `C1/gamez.zip`, the chapter's top texture tier (below),
`zrdr.zip` and `soundsh.zip`, **preferring the unpacked sibling folder when present**
(`extracted/C1/rtexture15/` over `C1/rtexture15.zip`). Each loader takes a zip or a directory, and
an explicit `--gamez=`/`--textures=`/`--zrdr=`/`--sounds=` wins.

**Chapter textures load from the top `rtextureN` tier, falling back to `texture.zip`**
(`SessionPaths.ChapterTextures`), where `N` is a **size budget in MB of video-card texture
memory**. ⚠ **The tiers are not mere downscales of `texture.zbd`, which a resolution comparison
misses**: the top tier holds the same file set at the same dimensions, but hundreds of those files
differ in pixel content, and the tier copies are richer, never worse (see
[formats/hud.md](formats/hud.md) on the gauge needle). `rimage.zip` is not loaded at all.

**`extracted/rof/`** is produced by the separate `ExtractRof.ps1` and holds the unpacked `.rof` UI
archives plus `ui_strings.json`. `PatternLibrary` reads the paint patterns out of it (`--rof=`,
default `extracted/rof`).

## `ExtractAssets.ps1` (repo root), the ZBD bulk extractor

Walks `CrimsonSkiesGame/ZBD` and runs `unzbd cs <mode>` on every ZBD with the right mode for its
type, writing to the mirrored relative path under `extracted/`, basename kept:

| Source | Mode | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `interp.zbd` | `interp` | `.json` |
| `planes.zbd`, `gamez.zbd` | `gamez` | `.zip` |
| `soundsh`/`soundsl` | `sounds` | `.zip` |
| `zrdr.zbd` | `reader` | `.zip` |
| `rimage`, `texture`, `rtexture*` | `textures` | `.zip` |
| `cam_anim`, `mis_anim` | `anim` | `.zip` |

**Extracts with the fork build** (`tools/mech3ax/target/release/unzbd.exe`); `-Unzbd <path>`
overrides it, back to the pinned `tools/mech3ax-v0.6.1-.../unzbd.exe` for instance, which needs
**no code change**, because the loaders read either extraction shape. Idempotent: skips outputs
newer than their source unless `-Force`. `-Unzip` also expands each `.zip` into a sibling folder,
which is what makes the viewer read loose files; `-Source`/`-Dest` override the roots.

Every failure-free run stamps `<Dest>/VERSION.json` with the `unzbd --version` line verbatim, the
exe's SHA-256, the fork HEAD, the date, and a hand-bumped schema integer the engine
compares at boot (`src/Session/ExtractionStamp.cs` warns, never blocks), bumped by any reader
change that invalidates old extractions.

**`messages.json`** comes from a step after the walk, since `strings.dll` sits at the install root
outside it: `unzbd cs messages` into `<Dest>\messages.json`, skipped with a note when the DLL is
absent, in which case the engine falls back to raw `MSG_*` keys.

## `ExtractRof.ps1` (repo root), the non-ZBD half

Covers the `.rof` UI archives (`GOSDATA/ASSETS/crimson.rof` plus the `crimptch.rof` patch overlay)
and the `langui.dll`/`language.dll` string tables, all into `extracted/rof/`. It writes each member
at its archive path, decodes each `.BM` texture to `<name>.png` (the greyscale
shading map) and `<name>_mask.png` (**the paint region masks**, R/G/B = paint slots 1/2/3), and
emits `ui_strings.json`, every UI string joined to its `RESOURCE.H` symbol.

It also emits **`menu_layout.json`**, the decoded `LAYOUT.CSV` screens, widgets, navigation edges,
script-created widget keys, out-of-layout art, `SCRAPBOOK.CSV` and patch-overlay precedence, which
runtime reads instead of the originals. Its decoder, **`ExtractRof.MenuLayout.cs`**, is `Add-Type`d
from disk and compiled by `CSVM.Tests` as well, so it stays inside the C# 5 subset.

`-Raw` skips the decoding, the string table and the menu layout; `-Force` re-runs an up-to-date
extraction; `-Source`/`-Dest` override the roots. Each run merges its own `rof` field into the
shared `VERSION.json` one level above `-Dest`, and skips that stamp with a note unless `-Dest`
follows the canonical `…\extracted\rof` layout. Formats: [rof](formats/rof.md),
[strings](formats/strings.md), [menu layout](formats/menu-layout.md).

## `packaging/Extract.cmd` and `packaging/Extract.ps1`, the recipient-facing extraction

Both ship in the release zip (`packaging/MANIFEST.md`) and neither is used in the dev tree.
`Extract.cmd` is the half a recipient double-clicks: it runs `Extract.ps1` beside it with
`-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, forwards any argument (so a folder dropped on it is the
install root) and holds the window open on both outcomes, since a console that closes the instant
it finishes cannot be told from one that crashed.

`Extract.ps1` takes the install root, or resolves one when it is passed none: it probes
`Microsoft Games\Crimson Skies` under either Program Files and a `Games\` or bare
`Crimson Skies\` folder on every fixed drive, reports what it found, and offers the folder picker
either way so the path is never typed. It then checks `ZBD`, its `.zbd` archives and
`GOSDATA\ASSETS` exist with a friendly error, and dispatches to the two UNMODIFIED scripts above
with `.\` paths anchored to `$PSScriptRoot`. **Keep all extraction logic in the two scripts
only.** Its one post-step unpacks `rimage.zip` into `extracted\rimage\`, because the HUD-font and
reticle loaders read loose PNGs there.

## Launch scripts

**`RunGame.ps1`, the play entry point.** `dotnet build`, then Godot with **no user args**, so the
launchscreen (`src/UI/LaunchMenu.cs`, Mode → Chapter → Plane) shows. Args are forwarded verbatim,
so a content arg (`--fly`/`--stunt`/`--plane=`/`--chapter=`/`--screenshot=`) bypasses it.

**`RunDev.ps1`, the dev helper**, same build step but with console prompts: no args gives
interactive menus (plane roster, chapter) and then `--fly`, flight flags prompt for what is
missing, and the static views (`--plane=`, `--chapter=`, `--damage=`) pass through promptless
apart from `--damage=`'s own plane prompt.

**`RunTests.ps1`, the verification entry point.** One command, one summary block, one exit code.
Stages, in order, each reported `PASS` / `FAIL` / `SKIP` / `TODO`:

| Stage | Runs / reads its verdict from / fails on |
|---|---|
| `build` | `dotnet build CSVM/CSVM.sln`; its exit code; a compile error, which also stops the run |
| `units` | `dotnet test --no-build`; the TRX log in `.scratch/testresults/`, never the console summary; any failed test |
| `engine` | Godot `--run-tests` in `-Shards` processes, windowed (LOG-8); each shard's JSON report; a failed suite, a missing report, a watchdog timeout (exit 124) |
| `goldens` | One `--det` Godot per manifest shot; the raw-pixel md5 on its `[core] shot pixmd5=…` line, not the PNG bytes (SHOT-6); a hash, frame or size off the manifest |
| `perf` | `-Perf` only: `analysis/perf/scenarios.json`; the `[perf]` lines, medianed into `perf-history.jsonl`; nothing, it records only |
| `hitch` | `-Hitch` only, last: two scripted launches; each launch's `.hitches.jsonl` sidecar; nothing, awareness only |

Switches: **`-Suite <name>[,<name>]`** (exact in-engine suite names), **`-Filter <substring>`**
(engine suite names), **`-UnitFilter <expr>`** (into `dotnet test --filter`), **`-Shards <n>`**,
**`-Quick`**, **`-SkipUnits`**, **`-SkipEngine`**, **`-SkipGoldens`**, **`-RegenGoldens`**,
**`-GoldenWorkers <n>`**, **`-Hitch`**, **`-SkipHitch`**, **`-Perf`** (+ `-PerfLabel`,
`-PerfCompare`, `-PerfFilter`, `-PerfIterations`, `-PerfFrames`), and **`-Graphics
original|enhanced`** (default `original`, which appends nothing; `enhanced` appends
`--graphics=enhanced` to the perf and hitch launches only).

**Every stage prints its wall time against a budget, and a budget never fails a run**.
The numbers live in `analysis/verification-budgets.json`, one lane for the complete gate and one
for `-Quick`, and live nowhere else so they cannot drift; each is the slowest of three
back-to-back warm runs plus 50 %. A skipped stage is compared against nothing, and the total only
when its lane's stages all ran.

**A selection that matches nothing is a failure**: `-Suite`, `-Filter` and `-UnitFilter` each fail
their stage naming the term, rather than reporting a green zero.

**`-Quick` is the broad partial gate**: build, the quick unit tier (`--filter Tier=Quick`), the
quick engine tier (`--run-tests=tier:quick`), no goldens and no hitch. Membership of both tiers is
checked in, as the `[Trait("Tier", "Quick")]` classes and `SuiteCatalog.QuickTier`. An explicit
`-Suite`/`-Filter` unions with the engine tier and a `-UnitFilter` replaces the unit tier. Quick
prints a `not checked:` line per omitted surface, and never satisfies the landing gate.

**The engine stage runs the full catalog in concurrent Godot processes.** `-Shards <n>` sets how
many; the default is 6 for a full run and 1 whenever `-Suite`/`-Filter`/`-Quick` names a selection,
and `-Shards 1` is the serial reference path. Membership comes from the harness's
`shard:<index>/<count>` term over the per-suite weights at `analysis/engine-suite-weights.json`, so
the same tree always divides the same way; an unweighted suite is charged the default and printed
as `not checked:`. Regenerate that file from a warm `-Shards 1` run's report.

Each shard gets its own log, streams, report and artifacts under `.scratch/engine/owner-<pid>/`;
what that does not isolate is a suite whose store sits outside `.scratch/`, so overlapping runs are
not safe (LOG-13). **The stage's verdict is the merge of every shard's report**, in registry order
via each suite's `index`: counts sum, the error allowlist's caps are re-checked against the SUMMED
counts, and **a shard exiting 0 with no report FAILS the stage**.

**`test-report.json`'s schema is versioned** (`"schema"`, bumped when a field changes meaning or
goes). Besides the per-suite rows and their registry `index`, it holds a `binary` block
(the loaded `CSVM.dll`'s path and MD5), the run's `selector`, a `shard` block and a `phaseTotals`
block splitting wall time into world build, disposal and the rest, so a report can be matched to
its build and the shard merge proved complete. Read the current field list from a report.

**The golden stage is scripted, not an in-engine suite**, because the `--run-tests` harness runs
every suite inside one `_Ready` call without yielding a frame, so no suite there can photograph
anything. A mismatch leaves the actual PNG and that shot's log in
`.scratch/goldens/<shot>.{png,log}`. **`-RegenGoldens`** re-renders every shot and rewrites
`manifest.json` in place, byte-identically apart from the hash lines that moved; GOLD-1 says when
that is the right answer.

**A shot's `frame` is checked before its hash**, off the capture's own `frame=N clock=<sim|render>`
field, because a shot that photographed a different moment is a clock regression and reads as
neither a pass nor a pixel change once it is folded into the hash compare. The capture names the
counter, never the harness: a run with a session reports its sim clock, which under `--det` advances
one step per rendered frame, and a screen with no session reports the rendered frames its countdown
waited, read off Godot's own counter rather than off the countdown itself. Both answer the same
question, so one manifest number covers a flight shot and a menu shot alike.

**Golden shots launch concurrently, `-GoldenWorkers` of them at a time (default 4)**, in
registry-order batches, each with its own watchdog, process, log and PNG. The default is
the fastest worker count that stayed bit-identical on the one machine measured, and
**`-GoldenWorkers 1`** is the serial reference path.

**The hitch stage is opt-in (`-Hitch`), not part of the landing gate**, because it never changes
the exit code: run it when landing a change to `HitchMonitor.cs`, `HitchSidecar.cs` or the hitch
tick in `Launcher.cs`. **`-SkipHitch`** forces it off even when `-Hitch` is given, and `-Quick`
never runs it. A clean `--frames=180` launch should
stay silent and `--hitch-inject=50@300 --frames=310` should trip once on frame 300; it runs last so
its evidence is never taken beside another stage's load (LOG-13, PERF-12/13/14).

### The perf stage (`-Perf`)

**A duration here is a count of SIM frames, never wall seconds.** Each scenario runs
`--det --perf --no-vsync --mute` plus `--frames=N --screenshot=`, and the saved-shot line prints
`sim_frame=N` so the count is proved rather than assumed (every perf scenario runs a session, so
its captures are always sim-clocked). `--perf` reports
a `[perf] window …` line per 60 rendered frames and a `[perf] startup …` line that closes
arithmetically over the build; the script parses both.

**Scenario set** (`analysis/perf/scenarios.json`, whose `args` are the literal command a human
re-runs): `empty-stage` (no gamez, the control a world or clutter change must leave alone),
`c1-flight` (the only moving camera), `c2b-water`, `c4-terrain` and `c5-city`. Defaults are 300 sim
frames × 3 launches, overridden by `-PerfFrames` and `-PerfIterations`; `-PerfFilter` narrows the
set.

**Protocol and verdict.** The first launch of each scenario is discarded, because a cold file cache
*reshapes* a startup profile instead of scaling it (PERF-7), and each kept launch drops its first
window, which carries shader compilation. The record stores medians plus commit, `--dirty` flag,
GPU string, the launch's `"vsync"` mode and the **md5 of the loaded `CSVM.dll`** (METHOD-6).
**A paired A/B is the only verdict**: `-PerfLabel base`, flip the one line under test (METHOD-5),
rebuild, then `-PerfLabel change -PerfCompare base` prints the ratios, calling identical hashes a
noise floor.

**What is read and what is refused.** The verdict metrics are `render_cpu_ms`, `gpu_ms`, the counts
`draws` / `prims` / `nodes` and the startup phases, and a row is marked `*` only when it clears
**both** a relative band and an absolute floor, each this machine's own noise (PERF-9…PERF-11).
Every other recorded metric prints as awareness only, each because its own instrument is unfit for
a ratio (PERF-1, PERF-2), with the reason in the manifest's `notes`.

**Exit-code contract: 1 if any stage FAILED, 0 otherwise, and a skip is not a failure.** A missing
dependency and `-SkipUnits`/`-SkipEngine` report `SKIP` at 0 with a `not checked:` line, so "the
data was not there" never reads as "the check held". `-RegenGoldens` reports `REGEN`, never `PASS`.

**Worktrees.** Extracted data and Godot are both found through `CSVM_DATA_ROOT`, so
`$env:CSVM_DATA_ROOT = 'Z:\CSVM'; .\RunTests.ps1` from a worktree behaves identically to the
primary tree; without it the engine stage reports `SKIP` with the path it looked at. The unit tests
fall back to their own checkout, so a root holding no extraction skips the engine suites but *not*
the data-dependent units. The other variable a scripted run may want is
`CSVM_TRACE_SISCRIPT=<node name>`, which makes `ScriptPlayback` log a `sitrace` line in the `anim`
category with that node's per-step pose, `dt` and step distance every tick.

Stray Godots are killed before the engine, golden, hitch and perf stages, **filtered to this tree's
project dir AND an argument only that stage's own launches carry** (SHELL-2): `--run-tests`, or the
`.scratch\goldens\` / `.scratch\hitchcheck\` / `.scratch\perf\` output paths. All quit by
themselves, so one still alive is stuck and ours; any other Godot here is left alone.

**All three scripts set `SDL_JOYSTICK_DIRECTINPUT=0`**, respecting a pre-set value, as the
controller-disconnect freeze workaround: Godot's bundled SDL hangs the main thread forever when a
>255-button DirectInput device disconnects, and disabling that backend removes the phantom views
while real pads keep working via XInput/HIDAPI. Removal conditions are in `backlog.md` under "Drop
the `SDL_JOYSTICK_DIRECTINPUT=0` workaround".

## Exporting a release build

`CSVM/export_presets.cfg` (committed) holds one preset, **"Windows Desktop"**: release export,
x86_64, `embed_pck=true`, so a single `CSVM.exe` with the pck inside, plus the **self-contained**
.NET publish output beside it as `data_CSVM_windows_x86_64/`. The exported build resolves every root
to the exe's own folder: it reads `extracted/` from there and writes its logs to a plain `logs\`
beside the exe rather than to the `.scratch\logs\` a repo run uses (`Log.DirectoryFor` is the one
switch). Per-user state is not in that folder at all: options, bindings, campaign profiles, scores
and custom planes are written through `user://`, which is `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\CSVM`.

**One-time template install.** The Godot export templates are user-global, not part of the repo's
pinned editor: extract the inner `templates/` FILES of `tools/godot-4.7-mono-export-templates.tpz`
into `%APPDATA%\Godot\export_templates\4.7.stable.mono\` (create the dir; do not keep the
`templates/` level).

**`ExportRelease.ps1` (repo root)** takes no parameters and runs the whole sequence: it checks the
export templates, the fork-built `tools\mech3ax\target\release\unzbd.exe` and the rest of the
payload exist (named errors up front), empties `.scratch\export\`,
builds, imports headless, exports, copies the payload in beside the output, and zips the folder to
`.scratch\CSVM-v<version>-win64.zip`. That folder is cleared because all of it is zipped, and the
clear refuses to run if it holds a junction, since PowerShell 5.1's recursive delete follows one
into its target.

**The version has one home: `application/config/version` in `CSVM/project.godot`.** Bump it there
and nowhere else. The engine reads it at startup for the log's first line and the menu's corner
stamp; the Windows export preset stamps it into the exe's file and product version, which is what
`application/modify_resources=true` in the preset is for (off, the export succeeds and ships an exe
whose Properties pane still names Godot's own template); and `ExportRelease.ps1` reads the key back
to name the zip. The script reads the stamp off the exported exe afterwards and throws if it is not
the version it started from, since nothing else about a missing stamp is visible. ⚠ The script
snapshots and restores `project.godot` around the export and is its only writer, the version is
read from that file, never written into it, and never stamped into the preset during a run.
The zip is built through `System.IO.Compression`, since `Compress-Archive` reports success after
writing nothing when a single file is locked.

The payload is `packaging/MANIFEST.md`'s table, copied from its repo sources on every export, which
keeps it byte-identical.

**`packaging/README.md` is the whole of what a downloader is told**, written for someone who found
the zip on the releases page and knows nothing else about the project: where the download comes
from and how to check its SHA-256 against the release page, the requirements including the renderer
floor below, the `Extract.cmd` first run, the `logs\` and `user://` locations, what the other files
at the zip root are, and where a report goes. Four things in it restate facts that live in code or
in this file, and go stale silently when one of them moves: the renderer floor and the
`[perf] gpu=` line a below-floor machine writes, the log directory and the version on the log's
first line, the extraction command spelling, and the payload list. ⚠ **The author reviews it before
any release**, since outward communication is theirs; it is the one payload file that is not
finished when it is correct.

**Two of the zip's files are about the build rather than part of it.**
`LICENSE-thirdparty.txt` carries the notices the payload's own contents oblige it to carry, which
`LICENSE` (CSVM, GPL-3) and `LICENSE-unzbd` (mech3ax, EUPL-1.2) do not cover: the Godot engine
linked into `CSVM.exe`, the engine's own third-party components, the self-contained .NET runtime in
`data_CSVM_windows_x86_64\`, and the Rust crates linked into `unzbd.exe`.
`packaging/BuildThirdPartyNotices.ps1` assembles it, reading every text out of the shipped artefact
rather than off a website: ⚠ the Godot Windows distribution and the export-template archive ship no
`LICENSE.txt` or `COPYRIGHT.txt` on disk at all, so the script runs the pinned editor headless over
a throwaway project in `TEMP` and reads them back through `Engine.get_license_text()`,
`get_copyright_info()` and `get_license_info()`; the .NET half is `LICENSE.TXT` and
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT` from the `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.win-x64` NuGet pack the publish
draws from, not the machine-wide `dotnet` install, which is usually a newer build; and the crate
half is `cargo metadata --offline --filter-platform x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` over the fork, with each
crate's licence text taken from the registry checkout it was built from and deduplicated by content.
The file's header states the Godot build, the .NET runtime version and the `cs-anim` commit it was
assembled for, and `ExportRelease.ps1` re-checks all three against what it is packaging, so a stale
notice is a build failure rather than a wrong claim inside a shipped zip. Regenerate when one of
them throws; ⚠ a moved `cs-anim` counts even when the fork's own code did not change, because the
crate list enumerates that commit's dependency tree.

`BUILD-INFO.txt` is the one payload file generated rather than copied, because what it states is
different on every run: the CSVM commit and the mech3ax `cs-anim` commit the two shipped binaries
were built from, each with whether its worktree was clean, plus whether `cs-anim` is pushed. The
export records those qualifiers instead of refusing on them, since building off a dirty tree is the
normal development case and only a published binary makes a false source-correspondence claim to
anybody; `PublishRelease.ps1` is where a qualifier becomes a refusal.

Two filters in the preset are required.
`include_filter="data/*.json"` keeps `stock_loadouts.json`/`effect_pools.json`, non-imported
resources the default export silently drops, without which every plane flies unarmed; their loaders
read them through `Godot.FileAccess` rather than `GlobalizePath` plus System.IO, which is what
makes the pck copies reachable. ⚠ `exclude_filter="config.json"` keeps the dev box's personal
tuning override out of every build. Smoke-test an export from a **bare folder** with a **foreign
CWD** and no `CSVM_DATA_ROOT`; either can mask a broken default root.

## Publishing a release

**`PublishRelease.ps1` (repo root)** is the publish, from one run: it reads the version from
`CSVM/project.godot`, runs `ExportRelease.ps1`, checks the zip that came out, computes its SHA-256,
creates the annotated tag on the commit that was built, pushes it, and creates the GitHub release
with the zip as its only asset. The pre-release flag stays off, because a build that is hidden from
the repository's Latest badge is not the one a visitor lands on. Because the tag, the exe's stamped
version, the zip's name, the published checksum and the notes all come out of that single run, none
of them can disagree with another.

`-NotesFile` supplies the prose that goes above the generated sections; the script writes the
verification and provenance sections itself, so the file never states a checksum or a commit of its
own, and it refuses a notes file that does. The generated text restates `BUILD-INFO.txt`'s two
commits as links, so the release page and the archive give the same account of what was built.
`-DryRun` runs every check and the export and stops before the tag. `-TagSuffix rehearsal`
publishes under `v<version>-rehearsal` instead: a real tag, upload and release to exercise the whole
path, deleted afterwards with the `gh release delete ... --cleanup-tag` command the run prints, so
the release version's own tag is still minted exactly once. `-Yes` skips the confirmation prompt,
which is otherwise the last point at which the tag and the upload can be called off.

**What it refuses.** A dirty CSVM worktree, since the release says the zip was built from a commit.
A dirty `tools/mech3ax` `cs-anim`, or one that is not on its origin: `unzbd.exe`'s source commit is
published as a fact about a binary in the zip, and a commit that exists only on this workstation is
not a source anyone can read. The CSVM commit needs no pushed-check of its own because pushing the
tag publishes it, though the script says so when `HEAD` is on no remote branch, since a reader who
opens the branch expects to find the release's commit in its history. It also refuses a `BUILD-INFO.txt`
that records a dirty or unpushed source, an existing release, and a tag that already exists either
locally or on the remote. ⚠ **A tag is never re-pointed**, which is why there is no `-Force`: it is
the source correspondence for binaries that may already be downloaded, and nothing on the
downloader's machine says it moved. The way to correct a bad release is another version, not another
meaning for this one. The tree and `HEAD` are re-read after the export for the same reason, since a
build takes minutes and an edit landing during one would tag a commit that is not what was built.

**`gh` must be installed and authenticated** (`winget install GitHub.cli`, then `gh auth login` with
the `repo` scope). ⚠ A shell started before the install does not have `gh` on `PATH`, so open a
fresh one; the script looks in winget's install locations before giving up, which is what keeps a
long-lived agent shell working. Every `gh` call passes `--repo` explicitly rather than letting it
infer the repository from the working directory, and the upload passes `--verify-tag` so `gh` cannot
invent a tag of its own when the push has not happened. ⚠ A `gh` or `git` call whose failure is a
normal answer, such as asking for a release that does not exist yet, goes through the script's
`Invoke-Probe`: PowerShell 5.1 turns a native command's *redirected* stderr into a terminating
`NativeCommandError` under `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`, so `2>$null` around one of those ends
the run instead of answering the question.

## Clean-machine runs in Windows Sandbox

**`RunSandbox.ps1` (repo root)** runs a release zip on a machine that has never seen this project.
It stages `.scratch\sandbox\<timestamp>-<vgpu|novgpu>\` with an `input\` folder (the zip plus the
driver script, mapped read-only) and a writable `output\`, writes the `.wsb`, starts Windows Sandbox
on it and waits for the driver's `done.txt`. `-NoVGpu` is the below-the-floor machine, `-MemoryMB`
its memory, `-MapReadOnly` adds host folders the zip does not carry (a retail install, an extraction
tree), and `-Driver` chooses what runs inside, so a later item can supply its own procedure without
rebuilding the harness. Everything the run produced stays on the host in `output\`: screenshots,
both streams, the build's own `logs\`, a line-by-line `steps.log` and `summary.json`.

**`sandbox/RendererFloor.ps1`** is the driver that answers "what does this machine do with this
build". It unzips to `C:\CSVM`, launches `CSVM.exe` the way a recipient double-clicks it, records
every window and dialog it sees (title, class, owning process and child-control text), screenshots
at eight seconds and at the end, copies `logs\` back, and reports the renderer from the build's own
`[perf] gpu=` line. A launch counts as reaching the game only if it drew its own window, put no
dialog on screen, wrote a log and was still running when the watch ended; when the plain launch does
not, the driver repeats it with `--rendering-driver d3d12`, with `--rendering-method
gl_compatibility` and with `--rendering-driver opengl3`, so a fallback that does work becomes a
documented troubleshooting line rather than a guess. With an extraction tree mapped it also flies a
chapter with `--no-vsync`, because whether a machine renders a menu says nothing about whether it
can fly.

What the rig had to learn, none of it visible in a failed run:

- ⚠ **The element is `<vGPU>`.** A `<VGpu>` spelling is ignored without an error, and the run then
  measures a machine with the host's GPU passed through, which is not a floor test at all. The check
  is the guest's own hardware, which the driver records first: below the floor it has only the
  "Microsoft Remote Display Adapter" and no registered Vulkan ICD, and with the vGPU on it has the
  "Microsoft Virtual Render Driver" and the host card's Vulkan.
- ⚠ **Ask the person to close the sandbox window; never close it from a script.** Killing the
  processes wedges the Container Manager until an elevated `Restart-Service CmService -Force`; the
  window ignores a posted close; and an Alt+F4 is delivered into the guest, or, when the raise the
  script asked for is refused, into whatever window the person was working in.
- **One session at a time.** A second session started while one is live comes up with no mapped
  folders and no driver, so nothing runs and nothing is written. The process to test for is
  `WindowsSandboxRemoteSession`.
- **WMI is access-denied to the sandbox account**, so the machine facts come from the display-class
  registry key rather than from `Win32_VideoController`.
- **The engine's flags are user args, so a scripted run passes them after a bare `--`.** Before it
  they reach Godot, which ignores them, and a `--fly` silently becomes a plain menu launch.
- **The logon command can fire before the mapped folders mount,** so it polls for them, and its
  console is invisible, so it redirects. That redirect is still buffered when the session ends, which
  is why the driver appends `steps.log` line by line and reads its own `summary.json` back off the
  share before saying it finished.

**The renderer floor, as observed.** The build does not refuse to start without Vulkan. On the
below-floor machine Godot reports `Required Vulkan instance extension VK_KHR_surface not found`,
then `Your video card drivers seem not to support Vulkan, switching to Direct3D 12`, and runs
Forward+ on Direct3D 12's `Microsoft Basic Render Driver`, which is the WARP software rasterizer.
No error dialog appears at any point, and nothing has to be passed to reach that fallback. The menu
and the no-game-data screen render normally. A flight does not: loading a chapter fills the software
device, `buffer_create` fails with `0x8007000e` (out of memory) tens of thousands of times, and the
process dies of an access violation (`0xC0000005`) about fourteen seconds in, leaving no window and
no message. Guest memory is not the constraint, since 8 GB and 16 GB fail identically. So the floor
is a GPU with a working Vulkan or Direct3D 12 driver, and what a machine below it shows a player is
menus that work followed by a mission that vanishes.

## `tools/` (git-ignored)

Downloaded binaries: mech3ax v0.6.1 (pinned pre-fork extractor, for rollback), the fork checkout
(below), and the Godot 4.7 .NET editor at `tools/godot/Godot_v4.7-stable_mono_win64/`; use
`*_console.exe` for CLI runs.

## The mech3ax fork (`tools/mech3ax/`)

**Crimson Skies support lives in the fork, not upstream.** Upstream removed it, so the fork is its
home and upstream commits get merged *into* the fork. Upstream is dormant, so syncing is a
check-occasionally rather than a routine.

- **Remotes:** `origin` = `git@github.com:Laeresh/mech3ax.git`,
  `upstream` = `https://github.com/TerranMechworks/mech3ax.git`.
- **Branches, all three pushed to `origin`**, since the fork and not this workstation is the
  authoritative copy: `cs-anim` = integration, and what the release binary is built from;
  `pr-cs-anim` / `pr-cs-gamez` = the same work split by concern; `main` = an upstream mirror.
- **Sync:** `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main` into the fork, then rebuild
  `target/release/unzbd.exe` and re-extract if the output shape moved.

The shelved upstream-contribution package is archived at [upstream-pr/](upstream-pr/).

### Window focus: scripted runs stay out of your way

The game window is **created without focus** (`display/window/size/no_focus` in `project.godot`),
and a scripted session also **hides its window** through `ScriptedWindow.Hide` once
`Launcher._Ready` knows the flags, which leaves rendering untouched where minimizing would stop it
(SHELL-13, SHOT-16). A hand launch still shows a brief flash, because the window exists before
`_Ready` can run, so `RunTests.ps1` instead runs **every launch on a separate Windows desktop**
(`HiddenDesktop.ps1`: `CreateDesktop`, then `CreateProcess` with `STARTUPINFO.lpDesktop`), which a
window can only join through the process that started it, so placement is decided *before* the
process runs. The summary line names the desktop used, and a refused desktop continues
visibly rather than failing; the rejected alternatives are in the retired `analysis/hidden-desktop/`
(`git show analysis-archive:analysis/hidden-desktop/FINDINGS.md`).

`RunGame.ps1` and `RunDev.ps1` hand the foreground to the new window themselves, finding it by pid
via `EnumWindows` (SHELL-13). Every `RunTests.ps1` stage launches through its private
`Invoke-Godot` helper, which uses the non-console binary and redirects both streams to
`<its --log-file>.out` / `.err` (SHELL-10).

**`RunProbe.ps1`, the same launch for ad-hoc runs.** A hand-launched probe would otherwise inherit
both the window flash and the console scribble a bare `& $GodotExe …` sprays over the calling
terminal (SHELL-10): **never invoke the Godot binary directly for a scripted run, go through
`.\RunProbe.ps1 <user args>`.** It forwards every argument verbatim (no build step, so build
first), runs on its own hidden desktop (`csvm-probe`, falling back to a visible but still
redirected run if the OS refuses one), parks the streams beside the run's `--log-file` or in
`.scratch/logs/probe-<stamp>.out/.err`, and exits with Godot's code. **`-TimeoutSec`** (default
**300**, `0` = wait forever) kills the run and exits **124**, so a probe that never quits cannot
hang a session. **`-Resolution WxH`** is forwarded as Godot's own `--resolution` ahead of the `--`,
which is the only way a scripted capture lands at a size a player runs: the project ships
1280x720, and a saved size cannot raise it because `--screenshot` implies `--det`, which drops
every saved option (DET-8). A resolution-sensitive artefact is invisible at the default size.

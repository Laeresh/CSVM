# Godot project, per-module implementation notes

**Start at the module index below.** One routing line per module, grouped by namespace. Find the
module there, then read only its entry in `docs/architecture/<Namespace>.md`:
`Grep "## src/Mech3/SceneBuilder.cs" -A 12 docs/architecture/` returns the whole thing, because the
entry shape guarantees it.

One `## src/...` entry per module in `CSVM/src`. **This file orients a reader and nothing else:**
what the module is for, what it owns, and which module to look at next. Entry shape: 1–2 sentences
of purpose beyond the index line, plus the pointers a reader needs. Body ≤ ~8 lines (~12 for the
heaviest modules). Entry order is historical, not grouped, the index is the map, grep is the lookup.

⚠ **Traps do not live here.** A constraint that would stop a wrong edit belongs in the code, on the
member it binds, under `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`'s comment caps, that is where somebody about to make
the edit is actually looking. Format and decode knowledge belongs in `docs/formats/` and
`docs/org/`; a way a measurement misleads belongs in `docs/verification.md`. Narratives, diagnoses
and landed-work stories go in the commit message.

⚠ **A new or renamed module updates the index and its entry in the same edit.** Both are in this
  file precisely so they cannot drift apart; `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` carries only the namespace-level
  map and must not grow a per-module list again.

**The family order.** The top-level namespaces are ranked families, lowest first: `Utils`,
`Extraction`, `Mech3`, `Video`, `Bindings`, `Sticks`, `Effects`, `Net`, `UI.Boards`, `Flight`,
`Spec`, `Session`, `Tooling`, `UI`, `Launch`, `Testing`. A type names only types in its own family
or a lower one; `Tooling` naming `Testing` is the one standing exception, and the remaining
inversions are listed pair by pair. The sub-namespace rules the index states under `Flight` and
`UI` are the same test's within-family rows. `CSVM.Tests/FamilyOrderTests.cs` holds the table,
the rows and the pair list, and is the authority where this paragraph and it differ.

## Module index

### `src/Mech3/`, extraction readers, world and scene building

Everything that turns the player's install into a live scene: the mech3ax extraction readers, the
GameZ→Godot builders, and the animation runtime that drives the world.

### `src/Flight/`, the flying aircraft

The plane as a flying, shooting, damageable thing, plus its HUD and stunt mode. Reads plane stats
from the extracted zrdr; owns the arcade physics and everything drawn over the pilot's view. Eight
sub-namespaces, one folder each. `Airframe`, `Weapons` and `Ai` name each other; `Camera` names
only `Airframe`, and nothing else in `Flight` names `Hangar` (the family order's within-family
rows).

### `src/UI/`, screens, overlays and the inspection labs

The launchscreen and splitscreen rig, the in-flight pause and results boards, plus the interactive debug labs. Every lab has a scripted
`--debug-*` twin so a finding can be reproduced headlessly, see `docs/cli.md`. Six sub-namespaces, one folder each, beside
the `UI.Menu` presentation tree. `Campaign`, `Screens`, `Overlays` and `Labs` are built from `Boards`; `Hangar` names only
`Boards` and the shared `UI.Menu`, and nothing names `Labs` (the family order's within-family rows).

- `src/UI/Screens/MissionEndFade.cs`, the mission-end black-out, painting `CampaignDirector.LeavingFade` onto a full-screen rect every frame, one instance per rig.
- `src/UI/Screens/SessionStartFade.cs`, the cover a session starts under, painting `StartCover`'s ramp over the HUD and the world until the session's first real frame, then up from dark.
- `src/UI/Screens/BuildStamp.cs`, the build's version as `CSVM v<version>` in the menu's bottom-right corner, with mouse-only icons that open the logs and user folders, over every presentation's main menu and the extraction screen; hidden elsewhere.
- `src/UI/Screens/ScreenKeyboardEcho.cs`, the strip across the top repeating the field Steam's on-screen keyboard types into, above everything while it is up.
- `src/UI/Screens/NoGameDataScreen.cs`, the extraction screen shown instead of the menu when the data root holds no extraction, an unfinished one, or one stamped under another schema: the install folder, Extract, progress, failures.
- `src/UI/Screens/ExtractionFlow.cs`, the extraction screen's engine-free state: the stale decision, the pre-fill, and a run on a worker marshalled to the main thread by a per-frame tick.
- `src/UI/Screens/InstallPicker.cs`, the install folder picker: Godot's own directory dialog embedded in the window, with pad buttons to go up a folder and take the one shown.
- `src/UI/Screens/SelectionService.cs`, the shared `--freecam` and `--anim-lab` selection: click-pick, the `cs_name` ancestor ladder, a breadcrumb and a highlight box.
- `src/UI/Screens/ExportSet.cs`, the node lab's Ctrl+click export set: cyan outlines, the breadcrumb's count, and one combined glTF at world transforms.
- `src/UI/Screens/PauseScreens.cs`, what the Original presentation's pause screen is made of: the mission's chart at its crop, the parchment, the memento and the strips, the authored four and the remake's photo strip.

**`UI.Hangar`**, the Build Custom Plane pages and the plane-picking tables they share with the campaign pages; names only `UI.Boards` and the shared `UI.Menu`.

- `src/UI/Hangar/PlanePickerRoster.cs`, the roster every human plane picker draws: the stock airframes then the store's saved customs. Engine-free.
- `src/UI/Hangar/PlaneDiagrams.cs`, the original's plan and head-on diagram sheets sliced per airframe, shared by ammo selection, the flight check and the hangar.
- `src/UI/Hangar/PlaneNameTables.cs`, the two authored word lists the PLANENAME screen rolls a plane name from.

- `src/UI/Hangar/HangarNamePage.cs`, the PLANENAME screen: two word steppers, a roll across both, and a typed name over the result.
- `src/UI/Hangar/HangarPurchasePage.cs`, the PURCHASE screen: the itemised bill, the totals row, and the purchase gate in the original's own words.

**`UI.Overlays`**, the debug overlays and keys, the HUD readouts drawn over a pane, and the mission chart.

- `src/UI/Overlays/MissionMap.cs`, the one chart drawer every screen showing a mission's map shares: the sheet at its crop, the reveal's pins, and an icon placed by world position.
- `src/UI/Overlays/ObjectivesHud.cs`, the campaign mission's objectives readout, drawn on the pause screen alone, one instance per rig.

- `src/UI/Overlays/TileGridOverlay.cs`, the map-edge tile-grid overlay (`--debug-tilegrid`): every ground tile tinted by repetition band, so one band is one block.
- `src/UI/Overlays/NodeLabels.cs`, floating `cs_name` labels over scene nodes (`--debug-names`, no key): meshes or all, anchored on mesh centres and de-cluttered.
- `src/UI/Overlays/MarkerOverlay.cs`, the `--viewer` firepoint, pylon and target overlay (K): coloured gizmos with de-cluttered labels.
- `src/UI/Overlays/ScoresOverlay.cs`, one pane's held Display Scores: the original's HUD text or a chrome table, while the pane's seat holds the action.
- `src/UI/Overlays/OriginalScoresText.cs`, the original's in-flight scores as monospaced lines in its decoded columns, and a race in the same grid.
- `src/UI/Overlays/ScoresTable.cs`, the Built-in standings of a held Display Scores, and the source both looks read a race or a Dogfight from.
- `src/UI/Overlays/PhotoModeHud.cs`, photo mode's fading hint line and its Escape or pad-B way out; it raises an event and decides nothing.
- `src/UI/Overlays/PerfHud.cs`, the frame-cost readout (F14): fps, current frame cost and worst recent frame, once for the window, drawn above the launchscreen too.
- `src/UI/Overlays/NetReadout.cs`, the `--debug-net` corner readout: a network match's desync counters, the line the launcher logs once a second, built only under the flag.
- `src/UI/Overlays/TargetingOverlay.cs`, the targeting overlay (F15): a line from every gunner to its acquired target, coloured by the gate holding the trigger.
- `src/UI/Overlays/DebugKillTarget.cs`, the kill key (F17): kills player 1's selected target through its own death path; inert on a turret, which has no health key.
- `src/UI/Overlays/DebugMarkerToggle.cs`, the all-aircraft markers key (F16): writes `TargetHud.MarkAll` on every human pane at once, the key twin of `--debug-markers`.

**`UI.Labs`**, the inspection labs; nothing else in `UI` names them.

- `src/UI/Labs/MeshLab.cs`, the geometry and shading lab (M): normal lines, smoothing seams, cull and normal overrides, on the parked plane or on the selection.
- `src/UI/Labs/WeaponLab.cs`, the weapon lab panel (B): steppers that arm the held plane's live loadout, and click-to-place on a world surface. Fires nothing.

- `src/UI/Labs/WorldDamageLab.cs`, the world damage lab (F19): an HP slider with kill and reset on the selection's own destructible pool.
- `src/UI/Labs/AnimLab.cs`, the `--anim-lab` debugger: a quiet stage, a fixed-dt clock, a transport panel, a def picker, the timeline and a freecam.
- `src/UI/Labs/AnimTimeline.cs`, the anim lab's per-sequence timeline: authored event blocks against runtime-fired ticks, the scheduler-divergence instrument.

**`UI.Menu`**, the presentation seam and its two presentations (`docs/menu-presentations.md`).

- `src/UI/Menu/PresentationId.cs`, the identity a presentation registers under and Options persist; `built-in` and `original` ship.
- `src/UI/Menu/IMenuPresentation.cs`, one presentation's lifecycle: activate at a mapped destination, tick over the host's seats, deactivate.
- `src/UI/Menu/PresentationRegistry.cs`, presentation registration: one factory per id, a fresh instance per activation, an unknown id refused.
- `src/UI/Menu/IMenuHost.cs`, what the menu host lends a presentation: the shared features, the audio, the per-seat sources, the one exit.

- `src/UI/Menu/MenuReturnDestination.cs`, semantic return destinations (top level, cabin, debrief) each presentation maps into its own graph.
- `src/UI/Menu/MenuChapters.cs`, the shared chapter roster: the eight chapter worlds, which carry Danger Zones, and the per-mode filter.

- `src/UI/Menu/CampaignCheats.cs`, what the original's four menu cheats leave switched on: the mission pull-down and its pick, the gallery reveal, the unlock-everything flag.
- `src/UI/Menu/CampaignAidProfiles.cs`, the scratch profile store the campaign screenshot aids seat a player over, unable to reach the real one.
- `src/UI/Menu/MenuIdleSource.cs`, a seat's input source with no device behind it, idle every frame; the screenshot aid's extra players.

- `src/UI/Menu/CoopHostFlow.cs`, what a co-op host names to its guests: its board, mission, progress, hangar with each plane's holder, debrief result and shared film, each guest's words sent again only when they changed.
- `src/UI/Menu/CoopGuestPick.cs`, a guest's own pick: airframe, fit, Ready and the walk-out mark, sent under the host's round.

- `src/UI/Menu/Original/OriginalShell.cs`, the Original presentation's screen graph over the decoded layout, its three partials below, and the dialog and cheats it holds.
- `src/UI/Menu/Original/OriginalShellDialog.cs`, the standing messagebox the shell holds: the box raised and taken down, the `DIALOG:*` answer keys, its rows and how it composes over the screen.
- `src/UI/Menu/Original/OriginalCheats.cs`, the three typed cheats the shell holds: each screen's authored region, its latch, the arming click and what a word fires.
- `src/UI/Menu/Original/OriginalScreenHost.cs`, the two sides of the screen-module seam: what a module reads off the shell, and the dispatch members the shell calls on a module.
- `src/UI/Menu/Original/BoardLayers.cs`, the eight lists a composed board is built out of, gathered into one collector every Original composer takes.

### `src/Utils/`, session-wide services

The things every subsystem depends on: the clock, the log, the seed. Changing one of these changes
determinism repo-wide; read `docs/verification.md` first.

- `src/Utils/AiStepCost.cs`, the wall cost of one AI walk over the flight roster and the aircraft it walked, the `--perf` term that attributes frame cost to the AI rather than to the whole frame.
- `src/Utils/AtomicFile.cs`, whole-file replacement through a sibling temp file and one rename, the write path every store of player data uses so a kill or a full disk never leaves a truncated save.
- `src/Utils/AudioBuses.cs`, the four bus names `CSVM/default_bus_layout.tres` ships, so every site that builds an audio player names its category instead of a string.
- `src/Utils/AudioMix.cs`, the player's mix: four 0..100 levels into one gain per category bus, Master multiplying the other three, bus 0 never written, no level read under `--det`, and the child gains captured and restored for a page's preview.
- `src/Utils/BuildVersion.cs`, the build's own version, read once from `application/config/version`; the log's first line and the menu's corner stamp state it.
- `src/Utils/Config.cs`, dev tuning-override: typed getters over an optional sparse `res://config.json`, else the caller's in-code `const`.
- `src/Utils/DisplayModeSetting.cs`, the window's display mode: the saved word against the shipped borderless default, and the one place the window mode is set.
- `src/Utils/EffectPools.cs`, the `effect_pools.json` reader: how many copies of each effect-template root the two stages build, scaled by player count.
- `src/Utils/EffectsLevel.cs`, the original's EffectsLevel option and the clutter fade's squared distance scale it drives, plus the remake's far-fade switch.
- `src/Utils/FolderOpener.cs`, creates a folder if missing and shows it in the system file browser, logging the open or the failure, and refuses in SteamOS Game Mode, answering which of the three happened; the stamp's icons and the profiles folder button use it.
- `src/Utils/GameClock.cs`, the session sim clock every sim consumer takes dt from: run mode (realtime/fixed), halt and single-step, time scale, the holds.
- `src/Utils/GraphicsMode.cs`, the opt-in enhanced-lighting setting, resolved at launch into the one boolean every scene builder reads, and switched live after it.
- `src/Utils/HitchMonitor.cs`, the always-on frame-hitch detector: a frame far costlier than its recent neighbours gets a record; it logs nothing itself.
- `src/Utils/HitchSidecar.cs`, the hitch detector's write path: queues a tripped record and drains it to one `[perf] hitch` line plus one JSON sidecar line.
- `src/Utils/HoldToRepeat.cs`, tap-versus-hold timing for one button: an initial delay, then a repeat every interval until release.
- `src/Utils/HostAddress.cs`, the stable global IPv6 address and the LAN IPv4 address a host names to its guests, with the temporary, deprecated, ULA and link-local addresses excluded.
- `src/Utils/MasterAddress.cs`, a master server's address as the option and the flag spell it, and the URLs of its paths, the socket's under the WebSocket scheme.
- `src/Utils/LocalNetworks.cs`, the IPv4 address and mask of every adapter that is up, read from the system for the LAN search, outside `Net` because that may not name `System.Net`.
- `src/Utils/Log.cs`, the diagnostic log: a fixed category vocabulary over four levels, a filtered console and an always-complete file sink (`.scratch/logs/`, `logs/` in an exported build).
- `src/Utils/MeasuredRenderTime.cs`, the root viewport's measured render CPU and GPU times, published by the render thread so a frame reads them without waiting for it.
- `src/Utils/MasterVolume.cs`, the developer gain on bus 0: `--volume=` over the `audio.volume` key over silence in a repo run, resolution only, with the player's mix a separate product underneath it.
- `src/Utils/MonitorSetting.cs`, the screen the window sits on: the machine's screens labelled, the saved index dropped where no screen answers to it, and the one place the window's screen is set.
- `src/Utils/OptionsStore.cs`, version-tolerant JSON persistence of the process-wide options (words, display settings, volume levels) in `user://options.json`, written atomically.
- `src/Utils/PaneReadback.cs`, one frame of a viewport read back off the frame path: an async GPU copy, the image built on a worker, handed to the Danger Zone cameras and the screenshot key.
- `src/Utils/PerfSample.cs`, ambient timed leaf scopes: `PerfSample.Scope(site)` accumulates per site per frame, and a hitch record carries the frame's named work.
- `src/Utils/PhaseCost.cs`, a row of named cost slots behind `--perf`'s `sim_ms=` (the physics tick split by session-simulation phase) and `proc_sites_ms=` (the process pass split by its heaviest consumers).
- `src/Utils/PhysicsTickCost.cs`, the wall cost of one whole physics tick and the tick count a wall second got, measured by a bracket pair spanning the tick.
- `src/Utils/GcTrace.cs`, the `--perf` GC readout: pause per wall second, collections, and the finalizable-object count that sets the pause, per ten-second window.
- `src/Utils/PresentationResolution.cs`, the requested-versus-active menu presentation resolver, force flag, then `--presentation=`, then Original, availability checked separately.
- `src/Utils/ProcessPassCost.cs`, the wall cost of one whole `_Process` pass and how many passes a window held, measured by a bracket pair spanning the pass.
- `src/Utils/EngineGapCost.cs`, the frame time outside every scene-tree callback, split into the engine step after a tick, the end-of-frame flush, the draw and the idle rest.
- `src/Utils/RenderPoses.cs`, the render half of the fixed-tick simulation: the pose a realtime session draws between two simulation steps.
- `src/Utils/RenderScaleSetting.cs`, the render scale: the saved/config `WordSetting` lookup over 50 to 200 percent of native, capped at native under FSR 2.2, resolved once at launch for the four 3D viewports.
- `src/Utils/ResolutionSetting.cs`, the window size: the sizes a screen can hold, the saved one against the screen's own size, and the one place the window size is set.
- `src/Utils/Rng.cs`, the session's one master seed and the named subsystem generators every random draw derives from.
- `src/Utils/SceneCopy.cs`, a node subtree's copy in place of `Duplicate()`, which under the separate render thread corrupts memory on any geometry node.
- `src/Utils/ScriptedWindow.cs`, Win32-only window hiding for scripted runs; `ScriptedWindow.Hide()` uses `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` on the native window.
- `src/Utils/ShaderTime.cs`, the `csky_time` global uniform: the clock's GPU twin, replacing `TIME` in every generated shader; wraps at 3600 s.
- `src/Utils/LoadProgress.cs`, the load screen's progress under a blocking build: the authored milestone table, the monotonic setter and the throttled repaint pump.
- `src/Utils/StartCover.cs`, the session-start cover's ramp: the dark tone, the hold until the first real frame, the one-second fade, and nothing at all under `--det`.
- `src/Utils/StartupProfile.cs`, the always-on `[perf] startup …` line: every session build split into the phases it spends its time in.
- `src/Utils/TextureUpload.cs`, every Image handed to a texture, at creation or repaint, held until the render thread lets go so a queued upload never reads a refilled one or swaps a handle off the main thread.
- `src/Utils/SwitchProfile.cs`, the live graphics-mode switch's per-step stopwatch, written on the switch's log line.
- `src/Utils/TapHoldButton.cs`, one button carrying two actions split by how long it is held; the caller feeds it the button level and switches on the answer.
- `src/Utils/AntiAliasingSetting.cs`, the anti-aliasing method (off, FXAA, SMAA, TAA, FSR 2.2): the saved/config `WordSetting` lookup over the graphics mode's own default, resolved once at launch.
- `src/Utils/ShadowQualitySetting.cs`, the Enhanced sun's shadow quality (off, low, medium, high, ultra): the flag/saved/config `WordSetting` lookup over ultra (high on an integrated GPU, off there at three or four panes), and what each level writes on the sun and the renderer.
- `src/Utils/WallCostBank.cs`, one `--perf` cost meter (bracket, banked milliseconds, worst span, count, tally) and the bracket node; the three cost facades are instances of it.
- `src/Utils/ViewDistance.cs`, enhanced mode's view distance: how much further clutter draws before its fade, the fog untouched, switched live on an apply.
- `src/Utils/WaterQualitySetting.cs`, the Enhanced sea's water quality (flat, waves): the flag/saved/config `WordSetting` lookup over waves (flat on Linux or an integrated GPU), which the session's wave ocean follows live.
- `src/Utils/WordSetting.cs`, the flag/saved/config/fallback lookup the five word-valued graphics settings share, its invalid-config warning and the `SettingSource` a log line names.
- `src/Utils/SunShadow.cs`, the shadow settings one directional light hands another, which the cockpit pass and the enhanced look share.
- `src/Utils/ViewportQuality.cs`, what the anti-aliasing method and the render scale write on a 3D viewport, in one call the four viewport construction sites share.
- `src/Utils/VSyncSetting.cs`, the frame pacing: the flag/saved/config ladder, and the one place the vsync mode and the frame cap are applied to the engine.
- `src/Utils/WorldBackdrop.cs`, the persistent environment's background: flat black while the menu owns the screen, the sky again at every launch.
- `src/Utils/ScreenKeyboard.cs`, Steam's on-screen keyboard by `steam://` URL, raised for a field a pad press or a tap armed, in SteamOS Game Mode only.
- `src/Utils/ScreenKeyboardField.cs`, one field the on-screen keyboard can be raised for: owner, id, label, live text and whether it is echoed.
- `src/Utils/SteamOs.cs`, whether the run is in SteamOS Game Mode, read once from the environment and settable for a suite.

### `src/Testing/`, the in-engine assertion harness

`--run-tests`'s suites and their fixtures. The units that need no running engine live in
`CSVM.Tests/` instead; the probes and capture tooling the suites share with the game live in
`src/Tooling/`.

- `src/Testing/TestHarness.cs`, `--run-tests`: the suite registry, `TestContext`, the PASS/FAIL/SKIP table, `test-report.json` and the process exit code.
- `src/Testing/FinalizerGate.cs`, `--debug-finalizers`: parks the finalizer thread for a suite and drains it at the suite's end, so a late wrapper finalizer errors beside the suite that dropped it.
- `src/Testing/SuiteShards.cs`, the `shard:<index>/<count>` term and the deterministic weighted division behind it, over `analysis/engine-suite-weights.json`.
- `src/Testing/SuitePorts.cs`, where each socket-opening suite opens its socket: an offset into this process's `--net-port-base` block, so concurrent shards never share a port.
- `src/Testing/ScreenKeyboardRecorder.cs`, a suite's stand-in for the on-screen keyboard: available, its URLs recorded, the detected state put back on dispose.
- `src/Testing/LoopbackMaster.cs`, the master server's socket side in one process: codes, guest numbers and signal routing, with no ICE servers, for the WebRTC suites.
- `src/Testing/PhaseAttribution.cs`, buckets a build's `StartupProfile` phases into archive/decode, sound preparation and world construction for the report.
- `src/Testing/CountingEmitterFactory.cs`, the no-GPU `IEmitterFactory` fake a suite installs to observe `PUFFER_STATE` emitter lifetime.
- `src/Testing/RecordingEmitterRenderer.cs`, the no-GPU `IEmitterRenderer` fake: keeps a `Puffer`'s particles instead of drawing, so its modes are testable.
- `src/Testing/SuiteCatalog.cs`, the registry of the in-engine suites, discovered from the `[Suite]` attribute on each body and ordered by name, and the checked-in `quick` and `ci` tiers.
- `src/Testing/*Suites.cs`, the domain scenario modules holding the marked suite bodies: puffer, combat, ordnance, Instant Action, AI, campaign, zeppelins.
- `src/Testing/SuiteConstants.cs` / `BurstTimeline.cs` / `SuiteViewers.cs` / `EffectStageSuiteHelper.cs` / `BotSuiteHelper.cs`, shared golden inputs, timeline values and fixtures.
- `src/Testing/MenuSuiteHost.cs`, the launchscreen fixture a menu suite builds on: a `MenuHost` with the launcher's features, one seat and silent audio.

### `src/Tooling/`, runtime tooling the game and the harness share

The `--dump-*` probes, the capture loop, the golden-image hash, the glTF export and the
`--synthetic-data` tree. The game and `src/Testing/` both depend on it; it reaches into the harness only to dispatch `--run-tests`.

- `src/Tooling/Probes.cs`, the assertion cores behind the `--dump-*` reports: one pass yields the report text and the verdict a suite asserts on.
- `src/Tooling/EnvelopeMargins.cs`, one flight scenario's distance from every term that could bound it, plus the decoded branches it drove.
- `src/Tooling/GoldenShot.cs`, the engine half of the golden-image tripwire: raw-pixel md5 + GPU adapter, printed on every `--screenshot`.
- `src/Tooling/MemoryAdmission.cs`, the engine's side of the machine-wide memory ledger: a scripted launch below the floor refuses to start, an unadmitted one registers itself.
- `src/Tooling/ProbeRunner.cs`, the `--dump-*`/`--run-tests`/`--*-test`/`--destroy=` probe wrappers the Launcher and the session node quit into.
- `src/Tooling/ShaderDiagnostics.cs`, `--debug-shaders`: the shader census, the frames after a live switch and every frame over 33 ms.
- `src/Tooling/CaptureDirector.cs`, the `--screenshot=`/`--shots=`/`--frames=` capture state machine, F11's camera-pose print and F12's save, ticked from `_Process`.
- `src/Tooling/GltfExporter.cs`, exports the viewer plane subtree to glTF (mesh + livery + baked damage) for `--export-gltf=`/F10, on a throwaway duplicate.
- `src/Tooling/SyntheticData.cs`, `--synthetic-data`: writes an invented `extracted/` tree into scratch from the fixture records and generated files, stamped synthetic.
- `src/Tooling/SyntheticTextures.cs`, the synthetic tree's C1 texture archive: the fixture manifest plus one generated PNG per entry.
- `src/Tooling/SyntheticPlane.cs`, the synthetic tree's stand-in aircraft `probe_plane`: its box-built model, plane records, one gun, one rocket, shakes and messages.
- `src/Tooling/SyntheticImages.cs`, the flat-block JPEG and uncompressed TGA writers the synthetic menu art needs beside PNG.
- `src/Tooling/SyntheticSounds.cs`, the synthetic tree's sound archive: the fixture `sounds.json` plus one generated ADPCM WAV per manifest entry, and the `voice.json` accent table.
- `src/Tooling/SyntheticMission.cs`, the synthetic tree's one invented mission scope `C1/PROBE1`: its `weather.json` and `net.json`.
- `src/Tooling/SyntheticEffects.cs`, the synthetic tree's anim and effect records: a box-built template gamez, a compiled anim archive, reader destructibles and two puffer readers.
- `src/Tooling/WavWriter.cs`, encodes mono samples as a PCM or MS ADPCM WAV in the layout `WavFile` decodes.

### `src/Launch/`, the composition root

The process and the per-launch session: the top family bar `Testing`, so nothing else names it.

- `src/Launch/Launcher.cs`, Main.tscn's root: the once-per-process bootstrap, what outlives a session, the menu host, and every path a session starts or ends.
- `src/Launch/GameSession.cs`, the per-launch session node: ordered build steps over one `BuildState`, composing the step modules and mode directors and owning the clock, world root, panes and tick order.
- `src/Launch/BuildState.cs`, the per-build state the session's ordered steps share: paths, archives, the world build's outputs and the running counts.
- `src/Launch/SkyStage.cs`, the sky build step: the weather rig with each rig's domes and deck, the cloud field and banks, and the lens flare.
- `src/Launch/SessionProbes.cs`, the build's scripted probes that report and quit, and the `--destroy=`/`--debug-objective=` build-time forces.
- `src/Launch/InspectionLabs.cs`, the build's inspection steps: the parked-plane view and its labs, freecam, anim lab, selection labs, the ocean lab, flight labs and debug overlays.
- `src/Launch/SessionBoards.cs`, the whole-window boards over a flight: the pause board and options leaf, the results boards, the menu readers and photo mode.
- `src/Launch/SessionNet.cs`, the session's end of the wire: the join, the seat list, the state relay, combat, chat, the clock and start gate, and the world links.
- `src/Launch/ProjectileStage.cs`, the flight's shared projectile pool build step and its world, crater, scorch and wash sinks.
- `src/Launch/SessionVoices.cs`, the mission radio and combat voice build step, with the AI skills table the voice and the activation floor read.
- `src/Launch/KillLines.cs`, the kill and crash lines each pane's message stack posts, the roster's AI included.
- `src/Launch/OppositionStage.cs`, the opposition build steps: the `--ai` squadrons, zeppelins, enemy generators and world AA emplacements.
- `src/Launch/ObjectiveReadouts.cs`, the objectives readouts and the objective-site feed on the target cycles, campaign or mission table.
- `src/Launch/EnhancedLook.cs`, the enhanced mode's sun shadows, screen-space passes, tonemap and sky on a sun and an Environment, on or back to the faithful defaults.
- `src/Launch/SwitchCover.cs`, a live graphics switch over a flying world: the flight held, a load board over the window, the switch run once it presents, both dropped when frames settle.
- `src/Launch/TuningWarmup.cs`, the startup pass that registers every `Config` key before the orphan report and `--dump-config` read the registry.
- `src/Launch/MenuAudioService.cs`, the menus' audio host: the music channel, the briefing narration player, the cue player behind `MenuCueTable`, and the AUDIO page's live mix preview.
- `src/Launch/MenuCueTable.cs`, the menu cue table: cue name to wav under the rof tree's `ASSETS/SOUNDS`, the four the globals script binds.
- `src/Launch/MasterServerLink.cs`, the shipped way to the master server over .NET's HTTP and WebSocket clients: the games list fetch and the socket with its two loops.
- `src/Launch/MasterFrames.cs`, the master server socket's read of one whole message, shared by the game and the server.

### `src/Session/`, the session-build layer

The session-build clusters `GameSession` delegates to, in five sub-namespaces, one folder each.
`Objectives` sits at the bottom and names one other (`Campaign`, once).

**`Session.InstantAction`**, one Instant Action mission.

- `src/Session/InstantAction/InstantActionDirector.cs`, the engine side of one Instant Action mission: the actor phases, the sequencer tick and the end-condition wiring.
- `src/Session/InstantAction/IaWrapupSnapshot.cs`, the final numbers an ended Instant Action mission hands its wrap-up, and the in-flight board seam the director drives.
- `src/Session/InstantAction/InstantActionRuntime.cs`, one Instant Action mission's actor set and its end, engine-free: the ace, wingmen, wave draws and objective zeppelin.
- `src/Session/InstantAction/InstantActionWaves.cs`, the decoded wave sequencer, engine-free: the wave counter, the spawn draw against live humans, the fan geometry.

**`Session.Campaign`**, the campaign director, the profile and what a mission leaves in it.

- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignDirector.cs`, the engine side of a campaign mission: the graph armed against the built world, the roster spawned and launched off its hooks, the attempt recorded.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignRoster.cs`, the engine-free plan of a campaign mission's `aiv` roster: each block's airframe, and its net or its netless escort.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignHumanField.cs`, the human field's rules, engine-free: what a condition naming one aeroplane asks once two to four humans fly.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignDangerZones.cs`, a campaign mission's own danger zones: the `dzpathN` gates its script arms, tracked per human by the stunt gate rule, each carrying its mission's objective number.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignSnapshot.cs`, the Danger Zone photograph a campaign mission writes into the flying profile's directory under the scrapbook row's own `Snap_<mission>_<objective>` name.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignProfileStore.cs`, JSON persistence for one named campaign profile: funds, owned planes, mission records, awards and the destruction log.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CoopPlanePool.cs`, the rule settling each co-op seat's own plane pick: one seat to a plane in seat order, the earlier seat winning a clash, the stock Devastator shared, and the wingman after every human.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignProgression.cs`, the rules that write a profile: an attempt's best-of merge, the monotonic position, the rewards and the skip offer.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignMementos.cs`, the cabin-wall pictures a profile may hang: the award table, which rows a profile holds, and the one bitmap name every screen draws.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignPersistLog.cs`, the cross-mission state log: what a mission left destroyed, carried silently into later missions of the same chapter.
- `src/Session/Campaign/CampaignLoadout.cs`, the bridge between a profile's stored ammunition and ordnance picks and the `LoadoutChoice` a launch hands the session.
- `src/Session/Campaign/ChapterCinema.cs`, which film plays before a campaign chapter, when it plays, and the single handoff to the passenger cabin that follows it.
- `src/Session/Campaign/ClosingCinema.cs`, whether the campaign's closing film plays before the scrapbook a flown mission opens, and the single handoff to that book.
- `src/Session/Campaign/LandingApproachRuntime.cs`, the mid-mission cutscene trigger: `landings.zrd` rows tested against each flying human, and the auto-land offer.
- `src/Session/Campaign/LadderSwitch.cs`, the rope-ladder switch as an engine-free rule and state machine, plus the co-op holder rule deciding which human owns it.
- `src/Session/Campaign/LadderSwitchRuntime.cs`, that switch flown against the built world: the per-human attitude and sensor read, and the definitions it starts.
- `src/Session/Campaign/NetPositionalStartLink.cs`, the landing rows, the ladder switch and the code-raising range gates over the wire: the host decides over the whole field and a guest replays its decision.

**`Session.Roster`**, who is flying and how each got an aeroplane.

- `src/Session/Roster/FlightRoster.cs`, the session's aircraft set: builds the human field in player order and introduces AI aircraft later through one assembly seam.
- `src/Session/Roster/FlightRosterInputs.cs`, the roster's grouped dependency contracts: aircraft resources, world bindings, human-session bindings and the policy.
- `src/Session/Roster/HumanFlightAdapter.cs`, the roster's private seat path, a person's or a network bot's: painted plane, controller, loadout, instruments, damage visuals, spawn, crash rig.
- `src/Session/Roster/AiFlightAssembler.cs`, the roster's private AI path: pilot preparation (a network bot seat's too), model, controller, loadout, damage and crash runtime, and placement.
- `src/Session/Roster/BotSeats.cs`, a network bot seat as its host seats it: Random resolved to a stock plane, the pilot-name callsign draw, the rolled personality and the tier's offset.
- `src/Session/Roster/AiAirframePool.cs`, the wave aeroplanes built in the loading screen and held out of the tree, so a launch binds one instead of building it.
- `src/Session/Roster/CrashRigQueue.cs`, the queue of crash rigs for aeroplanes already flying, advanced one build step a frame so a launch costs less on its frame.
- `src/Session/Roster/LiveryResolver.cs`, each player's livery from a `SessionSpec`: the paint catalog, the pattern-mask library and the per-player scheme pick.
- `src/Session/Roster/HumanFieldPlanes.cs`, each human's aircraft from a `SessionSpec`: the per-player pick and the Instant Action override.
- `src/Session/Roster/SpawnPicker.cs`, each player's flight spawn: the shared spawn-list index and the per-player point; also the plain `IFlightStarts`.
- `src/Session/Roster/IFlightStarts.cs`, the spawn-placement seam: one call answering for the whole field, and the `FlightStart` pair every rig is placed from.
- `src/Session/Roster/StartGrid.cs`, the abreast starting grid: every pilot fanned about one anchor spawn, the whole field lifted as one to clear terrain.
- `src/Session/Roster/SharedSpawnStarts.cs`, a time-attack race's start: every pilot on player 1's one spawn point and start state.
- `src/Session/Roster/SpectateHandoff.cs`, the shared pane handoff for a downed pilot whose teammates fly on: the wreck pinned, a spectator camera in the freed pane.
- `src/Session/Roster/AirframeSwap.cs`, the three `CALLBACK` codes that hand the player a different airframe in mid mission, and the def and node each names.
- `src/Session/Roster/GeneratorCycle.cs`, the decoded egen launch timing law for one generator, pure and engine-free: composed periods, hold-not-cancel, the credit.
- `src/Session/Roster/AiGeneratorRuntime.cs`, runs a mission's egen generators (`--generators`): the load drops, the cycle stepping, each launch's spawn or release, and a guest's replay of the host's launches.
- `src/Session/Roster/AiVoiceRuntime.cs`, wires the combat-voice dispatcher into a session: the speakers, the damage sources, and the flat radio queue every line plays on.

**`Session.World`**, the simulation step and the non-aeroplane things in the world.

- `src/Session/World/SessionSimulation.cs`, the plain-C# owner of one haltable, ordered session-simulation step; `GameSession` maps its named phases to their owners.
- `src/Session/World/WeatherRig.cs`, loads the mission's weather and drives the per-rig skydome, whiteout, deck and zone gate each frame.
- `src/Session/World/FogViewTable.cs`, the per-view fog and vertex-light table the atmosphere shaders search, so each pane wears its own zone's.
- `src/Session/World/LensFlareRig.cs`, the sun's lens flare: screen-space sprites along the sun-to-centre line plus the wash, one instance per pane.
- `src/Session/World/WorldEffectsFactory.cs`, builds the impact/destruction effect stages and the per-plane crash runtime.
- `src/Session/World/CutsceneController.cs`, the host a cutscene definition raises its `CALLBACK` codes to, and the session state those codes describe.
- `src/Session/World/ScriptedPathVehicles.cs`, one mission's scripted-path vehicles: the snap onto waypoint 0, the freeze, `START_TAXI`'s release, the handoff back.
- `src/Session/World/SurfaceVehicleRuntime.cs`, builds and steps a mission's `mode ship` hulls: a library-root copy placed on the water, indexed on the runtime.
- `src/Session/World/ZeppelinRuntime.cs`, runs a mission's zeppelins (`--zeppelins`): the placement, the net flight, the per-part damage and kill, the script's arms.
- `src/Session/World/NetWorldLink.cs`, the host-owned world over the wire: AI aircraft as launch, pose, fire, hit, presence and death messages, zeppelin and surface-vehicle paths as periodic samples, destructible health, stage changes and deaths as events, and warp picks.
- `src/Session/World/VersusDirector.cs`, the engine side of one Dogfight: the match and its scoring, the respawn rotation and grants, the host's match state, the rematch and the team modes.
- `src/Session/World/FlagRuntime.cs`, Capture the Flag in a network match: the mission's flags moved, asked for, decided, scored, spoken and posted on every machine.
- `src/Session/World/ZeppelinVersusRuntime.cs`, Zeppelin vs Zeppelin in a network match: the two hulls on their sides, the host scoring every dead part and ending on a lost hull.
- `src/Session/World/RearmRuntime.cs`, the multiplayer rearm bases in a Dogfight: each machine's own seats restored in full on entering a base that serves them.
- `src/Session/World/NetCutsceneLink.cs`, the cutscene skip over the wire: a guest's skip asks the host, and the host's skip ends the named episode on every guest.
- `src/Session/World/NetChatLink.cs`, the in-flight chat over the wire and its keys: an all-chat to every machine, a team line to the typist's lobby team alone.
- `src/Session/World/NetRaceLink.cs`, a stunt race over the wire: each machine reports its own runs, the host keeps the window, board and ending, and a guest's race replicates them.
- `src/Session/World/ZeppelinRuntime.Cannons.cs`, the broadside half of that partial: the cannon wiring, the target and arc gate, the anims and the rounds fired.
- `src/Session/World/TurretEmplacementRuntime.cs`, the world AA emplacements: placed against the built world, in the shared aim pool, stepped after the airships.

**`Session.Objectives`**, the mission script, the rules it runs and the targets it names.

- `src/Session/Objectives/ObjectiveScript.cs`, one mission's parsed `objectives.zrd`: the contiguous `OBJECTIVEn` blocks, in the typed shape the graph runs.
- `src/Session/Objectives/ObjectiveGraph.cs`, the objectives runtime, engine-free: the four-state machine, the rotating completion scan, the conditions, the four endings.
- `src/Session/Objectives/ObjectiveSites.cs`, the flown campaign mission's flagged target sites as targeting candidates, rebuilt from their live source every frame.
- `src/Session/Objectives/ObjectZoneGate.cs`, gives each flown object the zone its own altitude earns against the cloud band, so the band hides what is on its far side.
- `src/Session/Objectives/NetTrailerTargets.cs`, resolves a patrol net's trailer name (`player`, a zeppelin) to a live position, so an anchored net rides its target.
- `src/Session/Objectives/NetDirectorLink.cs`, the objectives graph over the wire: the host publishes every event its graph raises, stamped with its clock, and a guest's replicated graph replays them in order.
- `src/Session/Objectives/NetDirectorCatchUp.cs`, a guest's catch-up on a late director event: applies it, then advances the timers, cutscenes and sounds it started by how late it arrived.

### `src/Bindings/`, the input binding model

What a binding is, how one resolves against hardware, and the named actions a polling site asks
for. The registry that turns a device identity into a live pad and the map that holds the actions
both sit on top of these types.

- `src/Bindings/DeviceId.cs`, which device a binding is on, as a value: the one keyboard, the one mouse, or a joypad named by its stable hardware string.
- `src/Bindings/BindingControl.cs`, the tagged control: a key, a button, a mouse button, one signed half of an axis past a deadzone, a whole axis over an action pair, or one hat direction.
- `src/Bindings/AxisPairs.cs`, the four action pairs a full-axis binding drives and which member is the positive side, plus the absolute lever row, shared by the map, the store and capture.
- `src/Bindings/LeverTakeover.cs`, when a bound throttle lever commands the throttle: only after it moves, until another command arrives while it is still.
- `src/Bindings/Binding.cs`, one control on one named device, plus `ControlValue`, the held/how-far pair every resolution returns.
- `src/Bindings/IDeviceState.cs`, the tick's raw hardware state addressed by device identity; the seam that keeps resolution engine-free.
- `src/Bindings/GodotDeviceState.cs`, the live `IDeviceState` over Godot's `Input` singleton, resolving an identity to an index through a `DeviceRegistry`.
- `src/Bindings/DeviceRegistry.cs`, the joypad index-to-identity table, rebuilt from the connected-pad list rather than trusting an index across a replug.
- `src/Bindings/SeatDeviceState.cs`, the `IDeviceState` a seat reads: the platform's keyboard and mouse, plus the seat's pad set behind a placeholder.
- `src/Bindings/BindingSet.cs`, the bindings one action holds, ORed the way the original ORs its four slots, the deepest deflection winning the analogue read.
- `src/Bindings/InputAction.cs`, the enum of named actions, one per binding a polling site holds, contiguous because the snapshot indexes arrays by it.
- `src/Bindings/ActionMap.cs`, one player's keymap: which control fires which action, with assignment taking a control off every action that held it.
- `src/Bindings/ControlCapture.cs`, what a rebinding screen may capture, and the release-first scan that turns a press into a binding on the seat's identity.
- `src/Bindings/ICaptureDevices.cs`, the hardware a capture reads through: one reader per context, with the pad identity that context's bindings sit on.
- `src/Bindings/StickCapture.cs`, the stick half of a capture: 128 buttons, hat directions, and axes measured from where they rested, a full axis on a pair or lever row.
- `src/Bindings/IStickDevices.cs`, the seam a capture learns a seat's stick identities through, so this namespace never names the stick library.
- `src/Bindings/SeatCaptureDevices.cs`, one seat's capture readers, a `SeatDeviceState` per context over one pad list, on that context's placeholder identity.
- `src/Bindings/BindingLabels.cs`, what a rebinding screen prints: an action's name, a control's keycap name, and a row that counts what it is not showing.
- `src/Bindings/ActionSnapshot.cs`, the tick's resolved values, so two consumers reading one action in one tick get the same answer. No edges and no history.
- `src/Bindings/PlayerActions.cs`, the seam a polling site holds: a map, the tick's snapshot, and the pad-only keyboard gate for splitscreen players.
- `src/Bindings/InputContext.cs`, which set of controls a seat is reading (flight, menu, camera), because one control means different things per mode.
- `src/Bindings/DefaultBindings.cs`, the shipped keymap as data, one map per context, reproducing `docs/controls.md`, and the placeholder a pad default uses.
- `src/Bindings/BindingProfile.cs`, one seat's whole input: a map and a `PlayerActions` per context, plus the keyboard gate that applies to all of them.
- `src/Bindings/ActiveDevice.cs`, which side of a seat's hardware produced its last real input, and which of an action's bindings a prompt on that side names.
- `src/Bindings/BindingStore.cs`, the versioned JSON keymap file, one per player under `user://`, falling back per action to the shipped default.
- `src/Bindings/SnapLookRows.cs`, the original's eight snap-look direction rows, composed into one head direction, and the move of an old four-row keymap onto them.
- `src/Bindings/LaunchBindings.cs`, where a seat's keymap comes from when the seat is built: the player's saved file, or the shipped defaults, plus seat 1's stick rows.
- `src/Bindings/IStickRows.cs`, the seam seat 1's keymap is completed through from the stick profiles, so this namespace never names the stick library.
- `src/Bindings/PadRumble.cs`, one seat's controller rumble on the original's own effect table, routed to the pads that seat's bindings read.
- `src/Bindings/Pads.cs`, single owner of "which gamepads exist": the phantom-device policy, the launch-time roster split, the focus gate and `--no-pads`.

### `src/Sticks/`, flight sticks through SDL2

The DirectInput-only sticks Godot's SDL3 does not see, read through the pinned `SDL2.dll` and
filling only the models Godot's pad roster lacks.

- `src/Sticks/StickModel.cs`, a stick's identity as a value: the USB vendor and product id every unit of one model reports, printed `231D/0201`.
- `src/Sticks/Stick.cs`, a device listed but unopened (`StickListing`), and an opened one with its axis, button and hat counts (`Stick`).
- `src/Sticks/IStickNative.cs`, the stick library as the roster sees it: pump, list, open, close and raw reads, the seam a test fakes.
- `src/Sticks/Sdl2Sticks.cs`, `SDL2.dll` loaded by absolute path and reduced to its DirectInput joystick backend, behind `IStickNative`.
- `src/Sticks/StickRoster.cs`, the gap-filling roster: hot-plug, the input gate, normalised reads, identical units merged per model, the roster log.
- `src/Sticks/StickQuirks.cs`, the built-in per-model axis corrections (the VKB twists read negated), applied at the roster's one native axis read.
- `src/Sticks/StickDeviceState.cs`, the sticks as an `IDeviceState` keyed by model identity (`stick:231D/0201`), read by seat 1 alone.
- `src/Sticks/StickPump.cs`, the node that loads SDL2 once per process, publishes the live roster and pumps it each frame; hosts `--dump-sticks`.
- `src/Sticks/StickProfile.cs`, one model's bindings in one layout: companions, short name, the ignore flag, rows per context, and rows kept unread.
- `src/Sticks/StickProfileStore.cs`, the profile files: shipped texts read-only, the user directory the only save target, atomic and versioned.
- `src/Sticks/StickProfileResolver.cs`, which file is active per connected model (companions, then user over shipped, then name), and the rows it yields.
- `src/Sticks/StickProfileSet.cs`, the profiles in force, re-selected on every roster change; merges seat 1's keymap and saves an accepted screen.
- `src/Sticks/StickSkip.cs`, seat 1's stick skip press and held state for cinemas, boot cards and in-world cutscenes, read off the stick rows alone.
- `src/Sticks/StickProfiles.cs`, the engine side: `res://data/stick_profiles/`, `user://stick_profiles/`, and the one live set.
- `src/Sticks/StickScreens.cs`, the rebinding screens' save split (player 1's stick rows to the profile files, never the keymap file) and the profiles folder opener.
- `src/Sticks/StickLabels.cs`, a stick's caption prefix for the rebinding screens: its profile's short name, else `Stick` and its model (the Stick column keeps the model only when two unnamed sticks share a row).
- `src/Sticks/StickShape.cs`, the flight-stick shape test: three axes or more, axes 0 and 1 resting near centre in the roster's rest sample.
- `src/Sticks/GenericStickDefault.cs`, the in-memory default for the one stick-shaped unprofiled model: X, Y, Rz, Z lever, two fire buttons, hat menus.
- `src/Sticks/StickSplit.cs`, a device-state filter passing a seat's flight sticks alone or everything but them, so pad and stick rows of one keymap resolve apart.

### `src/Video/`, the MPEG-1 cinema decoder

The managed decoder for the install's ten `.mpg` files, from the container down to pixels and PCM.
It holds no engine type, so it runs in a plain unit test; formats and evidence are in
[`formats/cinemas.md`](formats/cinemas.md).

- `src/Video/MpegMovie.cs`, one cinema opened from its own bytes: the file's declared parameters, the next picture and the next block of sound.
- `src/Video/MpegSystemStream.cs`, the system-stream demultiplexer: each elementary stream joined into one buffer, with the audio packets and their timestamps kept.
- `src/Video/MpegVideoDecoder.cs`, the video decoder: sequence, picture, slice and macroblock, yielding frames in display order on the container's clock.
- `src/Video/MpegAudioDecoder.cs`, the layer II decoder: frame header, bit allocation, scale factors and requantisation, yielding 1152 samples per channel at a time.
- `src/Video/MpegBitReader.cs`, the bit reader every symbol is read through: bit fields, alignment, start-code scanning, the variable-length code walk.
- `src/Video/VideoVlcTables.cs`, the video variable-length code tables as data, each a flattened binary tree walked one bit at a time.
- `src/Video/AudioLayer2Tables.cs`, the layer II tables as data: the header's rates, the four-step lookup to a bit allocation table, and the quantisers it selects.
- `src/Video/DctBlock.cs`, the 8x8 block: scan order, the default quantiser matrices, dequantisation, and the integer inverse transform.
- `src/Video/AudioSubbandSynthesis.cs`, one channel's polyphase synthesis filter bank: 32 subband samples in, 32 PCM samples out, over a 1024-sample history.
- `src/Video/MotionCompensation.cs`, half-pel motion-compensated prediction of one macroblock of one plane, written or averaged into the current picture.
- `src/Video/VideoFrame.cs`, one decoded picture: three 4:2:0 planes, its presentation time, and the BT.601 conversion to RGBA.
- `src/Video/AudioFrame.cs`, one decoded sound frame: 1152 interleaved samples per channel as floats, and the moment the first of them is heard.
- `src/Video/MoviePlayback.cs`, a movie on a clock: the picture due now as RGBA, timed by the frames' own timestamps, looping endlessly on a play count of zero.
- `src/Video/CinemaPlayback.cs`, a cinema playing with its sound: clamped PCM out, the picture clocked by what the device has played, the two streams' start times taken against each other.
- `src/Video/CinemaHandoff.cs`, what every cinema flow shares: the shape of the call that puts a film on screen, the skip-press set, and the latch that opens the next screen once however many times the film says it stopped.

### `src/Extraction/`, turning the player's install into `extracted/`

The in-engine extraction: finding the player's install, then one module per format plus the run
that joins them. Only `RememberedInstall` touches the engine, so every decoder runs in a plain unit
test; entries are in [`architecture/Extraction.md`](architecture/Extraction.md), the output layout
in [`formats/extraction.md`](formats/extraction.md).

- `src/Extraction/InstallLocator.cs`, the case-insensitive install lookup: the segment walk, the picked-folder check with its mis-pick messages, and the per-platform candidate list.
- `src/Extraction/RememberedInstall.cs`, the last-used install folder, kept in `user://options.json` to pre-fill the next picker.
- `src/Extraction/RofExtraction.cs`, the non-ZBD half of an extraction: both UI archives, the `.BM` PNGs, the cinemas, `ui_strings.json` and `menu_layout.json`, from resolved paths.
- `src/Extraction/RofTree.cs`, the one upper case the rof tree is written in and the name mapping every writer and reader of it shares.
- `src/Extraction/RofArchive.cs`, the `.rof` UI archive read from memory: the directory tree walked without inflating, each member inflated on demand.
- `src/Extraction/BmTexture.cs`, one paint-shop `.BM` split into its shading map and its three paint-region masks as RGB.
- `src/Extraction/PngWriter.cs`, a managed 24-bit RGB PNG encoder, so no image library or engine type is needed to write the `.BM` PNGs.
- `src/Extraction/PeStringTable.cs`, the Win32 `STRINGTABLE` resources read out of a PE file's bytes, with no Win32 call.
- `src/Extraction/UiStringTable.cs`, the `ui_strings.json` rows: string-table text joined to its `RESOURCE.H` symbol and split from its `[FONTID]` tag.
- `src/Extraction/MovieCopy.cs`, the install's `.mpg` cinemas copied verbatim under upper-case names, skipping a copy already at the source's length unless forced.
- `src/Extraction/MenuLayoutDecoder.cs`, `LAYOUT.CSV`, `SCRAPBOOK.CSV`, `RESOURCE.H` and the GUI scripts decoded into `menu_layout.json`.
- `src/Extraction/ZbdExtraction.cs`, the ZBD half of extraction: every archive through unzbd, then `messages.json`, the optional unzip and the stamp, off the main thread.
- `src/Extraction/ZbdPlan.cs`, the ZBD half's pure rules: the archive-name mode map, output naming, the up-to-date and unzip rules, and the stderr notes.
- `src/Extraction/ZbdTree.cs`, the one case the ZBD half writes (folders upper, file names lower) and the chapter and mission path mapping its writer and readers share.
- `src/Extraction/ZbdProgress.cs`, the ZBD runner's options, per-step progress report with its console lines, and result totals with the closing summary.
- `src/Extraction/UnzbdTool.cs`, the bundled unzbd as a child process: its platform file name and release path, one run with both streams drained, and its identity for the stamp.
- `src/Extraction/ExtractionRun.cs`, the whole extraction in order (install check, ZBD half, `.rof` half, stamps) with one progress stream, cancel, summary and exit code, for `--extract` and the extraction screen.
- `src/Extraction/ExtractionStampWriter.cs`, writes `extracted/VERSION.json` without a BOM, merging one half's field and the engine's schema into what is there.
- `src/Extraction/SessionPaths.cs`, resolves the extracted-data paths (per-chapter gamez/texture/zrdr, per-mission zrdr) under a data root in `ZbdTree`'s case, unpacked folder or `.zip`.
- `src/Extraction/ExtractionStamp.cs`, reads the extraction provenance stamp at boot and warns once when it is stale or unreadable; `Behind` is the blocking read, `Schema` the promise a test pins.

### `src/Net/`, the network seam

What carries bytes between peers: the in-process carrier the suites run on, the ENet carrier a
match ships over, the WebRTC carrier internet play rides, and the one place a build picks between
them. Only the ENet and WebRTC carriers and the port mapping name an engine type, so a session cannot learn
what it is being carried by. The
original's own message set, with ids and guarantees, is in [`org/multiplayer-messages.md`](org/multiplayer-messages.md).

- `src/Net/INetTransport.cs`, the carrier a session sends bytes over: the peer roster, one send per payload with its reliability class and channel, and the listener arrivals are reported to.
- `src/Net/LoopbackConditions.cs`, one direction's wire conditions as a value: a latency, a symmetric jitter about it and a loss probability, every draw from a caller-supplied `Random`.
- `src/Net/SoakCells.cs`, the soak's three shaped link cells, which the loopback suites fly and `--net-shape` takes by name.
- `src/Net/LoopbackTransport.cs`, transports wired to each other in one process through delivery queues: nothing arrives until a step, so a suite owns delivery time and makes its own reorders.
- `src/Net/EnetTransport.cs`, the shipped carrier: the seam over Godot's ENet peer, hosting on a port or joining by address, with every roster change and payload reported out of one poll.
- `src/Net/NetLink.cs`, where a real socket's link stands (`NetLinkState`) as a board reads it through `INetLink`, and how many payloads a link holds before a listener binds.
- `src/Net/NetCarrier.cs`, which carrier a match runs over, chosen once: the door's registration and the command line both open through it, so no edit above the seam changes carrier.
- `src/Net/WebRtcTransport.cs`, the WebRTC carrier: a host listed on the master server and a guest joining by code, negotiated through its socket with STUN and a TURN fallback, the third type allowed to name a Godot networking type.
- `src/Net/WebRtcFraming.cs`, the frame a WebRTC payload rides in: the session channel and a per-channel sequence, with the sequenced discard a WebRTC data channel lacks.
- `src/Net/MergedTransport.cs`, several host carriers as one roster, so a host takes ENet and WebRTC guests in one session, each guest renumbered from 2.
- `src/Net/ShapedTransport.cs`, a real carrier shaped both ways at one end under the loopback's latency, jitter and loss model, what `--net-shape` puts on the command line's socket.
- `src/Net/NetEndpoint.cs`, a host and port parsed from a typed or command-line address, a bare IPv6 address all host, and written back with the host bracketed.
- `src/Net/NetPorts.cs`, the game and LAN discovery ports this process opens by default: the shipped pair, or the pair `--net-port-base` moves for a test process.
- `src/Net/UpnpPortMap.cs`, a best-effort port mapping through Godot's UPnP client: five outcomes a host can show, never a throw, and never required for a match to be joinable.
- `src/Net/UpnpLease.cs`, the router mapping's rules behind a gateway seam: no add behind a non-public external address, a finite lease, the stale mapping cleared by exact port, and when the door renews.
- `src/Net/IgdAddress.cs`, a gateway's external address read without the engine: its kind (public, private, carrier-shared, reserved) and the description and SOAP text a direct question is made of.
- `src/Net/UpnpPortMemory.cs`, the one port this machine last mapped, kept in the user directory so the next run can clear what a crash left.
- `src/Net/UpnpPinholeMap.cs`, a best-effort IPv6 pinhole in the host's router through the IGD v2 firewall service, found by SSDP and asked over SOAP: never a throw, never required.
- `src/Net/UpnpPinhole.cs`, the IPv6 pinhole's rules behind a gateway seam: no add without a global address, a service and a status that allows it, a finite lease renewed by UniqueID, a crashed run's pinhole cleared only inside its lease.
- `src/Net/IgdPinhole.cs`, the IPv6 firewall service's SSDP, description and SOAP text read without the engine, and the global-address check a pinhole needs.
- `src/Net/UpnpPinholeMemory.cs`, the one IPv6 pinhole this machine last opened, with its lease end, kept in the user directory so the next run can clear what a crash left.
- `src/Net/RouterAccess.cs`, a host's hold on its router: the port mapping and the IPv6 pinhole, each a lease renewed on its own thread and given back on close.
- `src/Net/NetLobby.cs`, a carrier's first listener before any session binds it: the host's session advert and closing word out, the latest of each in, every other payload held for the session.
- `src/Net/NetBuildVersion.cs`, the build's MAJOR.MINOR two peers compare before they play, patch ignored and unknown playing only with unknown, and the lobby's `0x56` message that carries it.
- `src/Net/LanDiscovery.cs`, the LAN search's datagram pair outside the carrier: a query and a reply of one width, so a responder never amplifies, and the `ILanSocket` seam.
- `src/Net/LanResponder.cs`, an open door's answer to a LAN search: each well-formed query answered with the advert and game port, a bounded count per frame.
- `src/Net/LanSearch.cs`, a guest's broadcast search in rounds under fresh tokens, one query to each target a round: the games that answered, dropped after a round without an answer.
- `src/Net/LanBroadcast.cs`, where a search asks: the limited broadcast and each IPv4 network's directed broadcast once, since Windows sends the limited one out of one adapter.
- `src/Net/LoopbackLan.cs`, the in-process datagram network the suites and aids search on: broadcast to a port, no real socket, no firewall dialog.
- `src/Net/LanDiscoverySocket.cs`, the shipped `ILanSocket` over Godot's UDP peer with broadcast allowed, the second type allowed to name a Godot networking type.
- `src/Net/MasterProtocol.cs`, the master server's wire, compiled by the game and the server alike: paths, type words, limits, the join code and the JSON.
- `src/Net/MasterSocket.cs`, the master server's socket as the carriers speak it, whole messages polled from the frame, with no socket API named.
- `src/Net/MasterRegistration.cs`, a host's listing on the master server: the first send once the socket opens, a change at once, the rest on the heartbeat, and the code back.
- `src/Net/MasterDirectory.cs`, the games list's master-server half: a fetch at most every five seconds, each listed game a row joined by its code, and the listing a host's advert makes.
- `src/Net/NetMessages.cs`, the message vocabulary: one struct per message, each declaring its type word and reliability class, over a shared four-byte header.
- `src/Net/NetWorldMessages.cs`, the host-owned world's messages: an AI's pose, fire and hit claim, a generator launch, a zeppelin's and a surface vehicle's path sample, and the world event.
- `src/Net/NetCoopMessages.cs`, the co-op boards' lobby messages: the host's flow one guest follows (screen, mission, round, Ready mask, hangar, result), the host's campaign films, its hangar with each plane's holder, and a guest's plane pick and Ready under a round.
- `src/Net/NetDogfightMessages.cs`, the Multiplayer Lobby's messages: the host's options under a round, the player list, one chat line, the team action and team list, and Capture the Flag's ask and flag table.
- `src/Net/NetRaceMessages.cs`, a network stunt race's messages: an owner's run report to the host, the host's race clock, and one racer's leaderboard line with its splits.
- `src/Net/NetTeams.cs`, the team core every team mode shares: a host's free-form named teams and the team launch check.
- `src/Net/NetPositionalMessages.cs`, the positional start: a landing row the host started and for which seat, the ladder holder, and a guest's held auto-land button.
- `src/Net/NetMessageWriter.cs`, the writer and reader cursors every message is packed and unpacked through: little-endian primitives, quantised unit fields, fixed-width text.
- `src/Net/NetClockSlew.cs`, a guest's offset onto host time, walked to each fresh reading over a bounded window rather than written, with one-way readings read forward by half the measured round trip.
- `src/Net/NetClockPing.cs`, the guest's question and the host's answer that measure the round trip, asked every ten seconds as the original's ping is.
- `src/Net/NetHandshake.cs`, what a host hands a joining guest before either flies: the master seed every stream derives from, and the host's session clock at send.
- `src/Net/NetSeat.cs`, one pilot's place in a match: peer, team, person or bot with a bot's skill, flown here and has a pane as two claims, callsign, airframe, paint, seat index and signed score, with the seat index as the whole identity.
- `src/Net/NetSeats.cs`, the roster's rules: sixteen pilots admitted behind sixteen-wide tables, the original's authored seat colours, a host's bot seats, and what makes a roster well formed.
- `src/Net/RemotePoseBuffer.cs`, one remote aircraft's received samples and the pose to draw it at now: placed by sequence on the sender's timeline, played out a fixed delay behind at the fitted sender clock rate, extrapolated along the newest velocity up to a cap, then held, with a tally of its reads and misses.
- `src/Net/AircraftStateCadence.cs`, when an owner puts its own aeroplane on the wire, in simulation steps, and the per-seat sequence each sample carries.
- `src/Net/MatchStateCadence.cs`, when a host repeats the match clock, in simulation steps: a second between ticks, and every change sent where it happens instead.
- `src/Net/NetChannels.cs`, which channel a message rides: one per seat for state and another per seat for fire, since sequenced discard is per sender and channel, and one for the join and every reliable event.
- `src/Net/NetSession.cs`, a session's own end of the wire: typed sends under each type's declared class, dispatch to per-type handlers, the join a host answers with and a guest checks, the host's relay between guests, and the counters a suite reads.
- `src/Net/NetInstruments.cs`, one machine's desync counters over its own traffic: sequence gaps as drops, stale and late arrivals, and reliable events out of their causal order.

### `src/Spec/`, the launch spec

- `src/Spec/SessionSpec.cs`, the launch args as one immutable, engine-free value: `Parse` parses **and** resolves, plus the pure arg parsers the tests reach.

### `CSVM.Tests/`, the unit tests

- `CSVM.Tests/`, the xUnit project (`dotnet test`): engine-free reader units on hand-authored fixtures + `extracted/` golden counts, skipped when absent; plus eight former in-engine suites moved here as `Probes.*`/plain-static/`StuntMission`/`GaugeCluster` facts.

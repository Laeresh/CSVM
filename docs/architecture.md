# Godot project, per-module implementation notes

**Start at the module index below.** One routing line per module, grouped by namespace. Find the
module there, then read only its entry in `docs/architecture/<Namespace>.md`:
`Grep "## src/Mech3/SceneBuilder.cs" -A 12 docs/architecture/` returns the whole thing, because the
entry shape guarantees it.

One `## src/...` entry per module in `CSVM/src`. **This file orients a reader and nothing else:**
what the module is for, what it owns, and which module to look at next. Entry shape: 1–2 sentences
of purpose beyond the index line, plus the pointers a reader needs. Body ≤ ~8 lines (~12 for the
heaviest modules). Entry order is historical, not grouped, the index is the map, grep is the lookup.

⚠ **Traps do not live here.** A constraint that would stop a wrong edit belongs in the code, on the
member it binds, under `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`'s comment caps, that is where somebody about to make
the edit is actually looking. Format and decode knowledge belongs in `docs/formats/` and
`docs/org/`; a way a measurement misleads belongs in `docs/verification.md`. Narratives, diagnoses
and landed-work stories go in the commit message.

⚠ **A new or renamed module updates the index and its entry in the same edit.** Both are in this
  file precisely so they cannot drift apart; `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` carries only the namespace-level
  map and must not grow a per-module list again.

## Module index

### `src/Mech3/`, extraction readers, world and scene building

Everything that turns the player's install into a live scene: the mech3ax extraction readers, the
GameZ→Godot builders, and the animation runtime that drives the world.

- `src/Mech3/GameZ.cs`, GameZ extraction loader (zip or dir): nodes/models/materials/textures JSON → C# objects, either extraction shape.

- `src/Flight/ControlSurfaceMix.cs`, the decoded control-surface angle solver: three stick channels into six clamped slots, smoothed at 2/s. No scene node.
- `src/Flight/ControlSurfaceAnimator.cs`, poses ailerons/elevators/rudders from those slot angles; `--fly` only.
- `src/Flight/WingLightBlinker.cs`, blinks the wingtip flares for about a frame every 1.5 s, reset off on respawn; `--fly` only.

- `src/Flight/PlaneCollider.cs`, derives up to 8 plane-frame convex collision hulls from the built model's triangles, with no per-plane data.
- `src/Flight/ConvexHull.cs`, an engine-free convex hull over a point cloud: vertices, faces, thickness padding and the point-distance query.
- `src/Flight/ScreenSize.cs`, screen-space sizing for world sprites: the pixel-floor inversion, and the nearest-viewer floor one shared mesh takes.
- `src/Flight/CollisionLayers.cs`, the named physics layers (world / aircraft): the one place a layer bit is assigned a meaning.
- `src/Flight/CollisionDamage.cs`, the original's collision arithmetic: the severity cosine, the damage pair's terms, the camera kick, and the grace windows.
- `src/Flight/AircraftBody.cs`, the flying plane's physics body: the shared `PlaneCollider` hulls on the aircraft layer; struck shape → part name.
- `src/Flight/IWorldQuery.cs`, the one seam onto the live physics world: a shape swept along a motion, a ray, and a standing overlap test.
- `src/Flight/GodotWorldQuery.cs`, the only adapter over `DirectSpaceState`; implements `IWorldQuery`.
- `src/Flight/GroundShadowLaw.cs`, the aircraft ground shadow as a pure rule: direction, both fades, footprint scale, derived colour, spread and ramp.
- `src/Flight/GroundShadowSilhouette.cs`, one caster's shape: the aircraft's own triangles rasterised top-down into its 64x64 coverage texture every frame.
- `src/Flight/GroundShadowPass.cs`, the per-frame pass that draws it: one modulating quad per aircraft over the ground a downward ray finds, original graphics mode only.
- `src/Flight/ContactReport.cs`, one detected contact as a value: impact, normal, struck part, collider name, stop fraction, and whether it was an aeroplane.

- `src/Flight/GaugeCluster.cs`, the cockpit dials as HUD (altimeter/speedo/damage + gun/missile), geometry from the plane's `gauges` subtree.
- `src/Flight/FlightController.cs`, the flying-aircraft node: input → FlightModel → transform, weapons, collision, crash and respawn.
- `src/Flight/FlightHud.cs`, everything one pane draws for its pilot, fed one per-frame state struct; the controller's seven HUD collaborators live here.
- `src/Flight/FlightControllerBuild.cs`, FlightRoster's internal, write-once construction handoff for a controller before tree attachment.
- `src/Flight/IFlightInputSource.cs`, the seam a sim step reads this frame's pilot intent through; `Bind` resolves one of its three adapters once per aircraft.

- `src/Effects/WorldWind.cs`, the mission's global wind (static vector plus random-walk gust) and `EffectAmbience`, the seam a `Puffer` reads it through.

### `src/UI/`, screens, overlays and the inspection labs

The launchscreen and splitscreen rig, plus the interactive debug labs. Every lab has a scripted
`--debug-*` twin so a finding can be reproduced headlessly, see `docs/cli.md`.

### `src/Utils/`, session-wide services

The things every subsystem depends on: the clock, the log, the seed. Changing one of these changes
determinism repo-wide; read `docs/verification.md` first.

- `src/Utils/AiStepCost.cs`, the wall cost of one AI walk over the flight roster and the aircraft it walked, the `--perf` term that attributes frame cost to the AI rather than to the whole frame.
- `src/Utils/AudioBuses.cs`, the four bus names `CSVM/default_bus_layout.tres` ships, so every site that builds an audio player names its category instead of a string.
- `src/Utils/AudioMix.cs`, the player's mix: four 0..100 levels into one gain per category bus, Master multiplying the other three, bus 0 never written, no level read under `--det`, and the child gains captured and restored for a page's preview.
- `src/Utils/BuildVersion.cs`, the build's own version, read once from `application/config/version`; the log's first line and the menu's corner stamp state it.
- `src/Utils/Config.cs`, dev tuning-override: typed getters over an optional sparse `res://config.json`, else the caller's in-code `const`.
- `src/Utils/DisplayModeSetting.cs`, the window's display mode: the saved word against the shipped borderless default, and the one place the window mode is set.
- `src/Utils/EffectPools.cs`, the `effect_pools.json` reader: how many copies of each effect-template root the two stages build, scaled by player count.
- `src/Utils/EffectsLevel.cs`, the original's EffectsLevel option and the clutter fade's squared distance scale it drives, plus the remake's far-fade switch.
- `src/Utils/GameClock.cs`, the session sim clock every sim consumer takes dt from: run mode (realtime/fixed), halt and single-step, time scale, the holds.
- `src/Utils/GraphicsMode.cs`, the opt-in enhanced-lighting setting, resolved once at launch into the one boolean every scene builder reads.
- `src/Utils/HitchMonitor.cs`, the always-on frame-hitch detector: a frame far costlier than its recent neighbours gets a record; it logs nothing itself.
- `src/Utils/HitchSidecar.cs`, the hitch detector's write path: queues a tripped record and drains it to one `[perf] hitch` line plus one JSON sidecar line.
- `src/Utils/HoldToRepeat.cs`, tap-versus-hold timing for one button: an initial delay, then a repeat every interval until release.
- `src/Utils/Log.cs`, the diagnostic log: a fixed category vocabulary over four levels, a filtered console and an always-complete file sink (`.scratch/logs/`, `logs/` in an exported build).
- `src/Utils/MasterVolume.cs`, the developer gain on bus 0: `--volume=` over the `audio.volume` key over silence in a repo run, resolution only, with the player's mix a separate product underneath it.
- `src/Utils/MonitorSetting.cs`, the screen the window sits on: the machine's screens labelled, the saved index dropped where no screen answers to it, and the one place the window's screen is set.
- `src/Utils/OptionsStore.cs`, version-tolerant JSON persistence of the process-wide options (words, display settings, volume levels) in `user://options.json`, written atomically.
- `src/Utils/PerfSample.cs`, ambient timed leaf scopes: `PerfSample.Scope(site)` accumulates per site per frame, and a hitch record carries the frame's named work.
- `src/Utils/PhysicsTickCost.cs`, the wall cost of one whole physics tick and the tick count a wall second got, measured by a bracket pair spanning the tick.
- `src/Utils/GcTrace.cs`, the `--perf` GC readout: pause per wall second, collections, and the finalizable-object count that sets the pause, per ten-second window.
- `src/Utils/PresentationResolution.cs`, the requested-versus-active menu presentation resolver, availability checked separately from the saved request.
- `src/Utils/ProcessPassCost.cs`, the wall cost of one whole `_Process` pass and how many passes a window held, measured by a bracket pair spanning the pass.
- `src/Utils/RenderPoses.cs`, the render half of the fixed-tick simulation: the pose a realtime session draws between two simulation steps.
- `src/Utils/ResolutionSetting.cs`, the window size: the sizes a screen can hold, the saved one against the screen's own size, and the one place the window size is set.
- `src/Utils/Rng.cs`, the session's one master seed and the named subsystem generators every random draw derives from.
- `src/Utils/ScriptedWindow.cs`, Win32-only window hiding for scripted runs; `ScriptedWindow.Hide()` uses `ShowWindow(SW_HIDE)` on the native window.
- `src/Utils/ShaderTime.cs`, the `csky_time` global uniform: the clock's GPU twin, replacing `TIME` in every generated shader; wraps at 3600 s.
- `src/Utils/LoadProgress.cs`, the load screen's progress under a blocking build: the authored milestone table, the monotonic setter and the throttled repaint pump.
- `src/Utils/StartupProfile.cs`, the always-on `[perf] startup …` line: every session build split into the phases it spends its time in.
- `src/Utils/TapHoldButton.cs`, one button carrying two actions split by how long it is held; the caller feeds it the button level and switches on the answer.
- `src/Utils/WallCostBank.cs`, one `--perf` cost meter (bracket, banked milliseconds, worst span, count, tally) and the bracket node; the three cost facades are instances of it.
- `src/Utils/VSyncSetting.cs`, the frame pacing: the flag/saved/config ladder, and the one place the vsync mode and the frame cap are applied to the engine.
- `src/Utils/WorldBackdrop.cs`, the persistent environment's background: flat black while the menu owns the screen, the sky again at every launch.

### `src/Testing/`, the in-engine assertion harness

`--run-tests` and the `--dump-*` probes. The units that need no running engine live in `CSVM.Tests/`
instead.

- `src/Testing/Probes.cs`, the assertion cores behind the `--dump-*` reports: one pass yields the report text and the verdict a suite asserts on.
- `src/Testing/EnvelopeMargins.cs`, one flight scenario's distance from every term that could bound it, plus the decoded branches it drove.
- `src/Testing/TestHarness.cs`, `--run-tests`: the suite registry, `TestContext`, the PASS/FAIL/SKIP table, `test-report.json` and the process exit code.
- `src/Testing/SuiteShards.cs`, the `shard:<index>/<count>` term and the deterministic weighted division behind it, over `analysis/engine-suite-weights.json`.
- `src/Testing/PhaseAttribution.cs`, buckets a build's `StartupProfile` phases into archive/decode, sound preparation and world construction for the report.
- `src/Testing/CountingEmitterFactory.cs`, the no-GPU `IEmitterFactory` fake a suite installs to observe `PUFFER_STATE` emitter lifetime.
- `src/Testing/RecordingEmitterRenderer.cs`, the no-GPU `IEmitterRenderer` fake: keeps a `Puffer`'s particles instead of drawing, so its modes are testable.
- `src/Testing/SuiteCatalog.cs`, the registry of the in-engine suites, discovered from the `[Suite]` attribute on each body and ordered by name.
- `src/Testing/*Suites.cs`, the domain scenario modules holding the marked suite bodies: puffer, combat, ordnance, Instant Action, AI, campaign, zeppelins.
- `src/Testing/SuiteConstants.cs` / `BurstTimeline.cs` / `SuiteViewers.cs` / `EffectStageSuiteHelper.cs`, shared golden inputs, timeline values and fixtures.
- `src/Testing/MenuSuiteHost.cs`, the launchscreen fixture a menu suite builds on: a `MenuHost` with the launcher's features, one seat and silent audio.
- `src/Testing/GoldenShot.cs`, the engine half of the golden-image tripwire: raw-pixel md5 + GPU adapter, printed on every `--screenshot`.
- `src/Testing/ProbeRunner.cs`, the `--dump-*`/`--run-tests`/`--*-test`/`--destroy=` probe wrappers the Launcher and the session node quit into.
- `src/Testing/CaptureDirector.cs`, the `--screenshot=`/`--shots=`/`--frames=` capture state machine + F11/F12, ticked from `_Process`.
- `src/Testing/GltfExporter.cs`, exports the viewer plane subtree to glTF (mesh + livery + baked damage) for `--export-gltf=`/F10, on a throwaway duplicate.

### `src/Session/`, the launch/session layer

The `Launcher` scene root, the per-launch `GameSession` node, and the low-coupling session-build
clusters they delegate to.

- `src/Session/Launcher.cs`, Main.tscn's root: the once-per-process bootstrap, what outlives a session, the menu host, and every path a session starts or ends.
- `src/Session/GameSession.cs`, the per-launch session node: ordered build phases over one `SessionSpec`, owning the clock, world root, panes and runtimes.
- `src/Session/SessionSimulation.cs`, the plain-C# owner of one haltable, ordered session-simulation step; `GameSession` maps its named phases to their owners.
- `src/Session/ExtractionStamp.cs`, reads the extraction provenance stamp at boot and warns once when it is stale or unreadable; `Behind` is the blocking read, `Schema` the promise a test pins.
- `src/Session/MenuAudioService.cs`, the menus' audio host: the music channel, the briefing narration player, the cue player behind `MenuCueTable`, and the AUDIO page's live mix preview.
- `src/Session/LiveryResolver.cs`, each player's livery from a `SessionSpec`: the paint catalog, the pattern-mask library and the per-player scheme pick.
- `src/Session/SpawnPicker.cs`, each player's flight spawn: the shared spawn-list index and the per-player point; also the plain `IFlightStarts`.
- `src/Session/IFlightStarts.cs`, the spawn-placement seam: one call answering for the whole field, and the `FlightStart` pair every rig is placed from.
- `src/Session/StartGrid.cs`, the abreast starting grid: every pilot fanned about one anchor spawn, the whole field lifted as one to clear terrain.
- `src/Session/PlaneRoster.cs`, pure lookups over a `SessionSpec`'s plane roster: which plane a player flies, and its display name.
- `src/Session/EffectCatalogue.cs`, the name tables saying which authored anims are playable effects, and the anchor roots both effect binds stage from.
- `src/Session/SurfaceDefTable.cs`, one of the original's per-surface anim-def vectors and the cascade that indexes it with a struck material's surface id.
- `src/Session/WeatherRig.cs`, loads the mission's weather and drives the per-rig skydome, whiteout, deck and zone gate each frame.
- `src/Session/WorldEffectsFactory.cs`, builds the impact/destruction effect stages and the per-plane crash runtime.

- `src/Session/FlightRoster.cs`, the session's aircraft set: builds the human field in player order and introduces AI aircraft later through one assembly seam.
- `src/Session/FlightRosterInputs.cs`, the roster's grouped dependency contracts: aircraft resources, world bindings, human-session bindings and the policy.
- `src/Session/HumanFlightAdapter.cs`, the roster's private human path: painted plane, controller, loadout, instruments, damage visuals, spawn, crash rig.
- `src/Session/AiFlightAssembler.cs`, the roster's private AI path: pilot preparation, model, controller, loadout, damage and crash runtime, and placement.
- `src/Session/CrashRigQueue.cs`, the queue of crash rigs for aeroplanes already flying, advanced one build step a frame so a launch costs less on its frame.
- `src/Session/InstantActionDirector.cs`, the engine side of one Instant Action mission: the actor phases, the sequencer tick and the end-condition wiring.
- `src/Session/InstantActionRuntime.cs`, one Instant Action mission's actor set and its end, engine-free: the ace, wingmen, wave draws and objective zeppelin.
- `src/Session/InstantActionWaves.cs`, the decoded wave sequencer, engine-free: the wave counter, the spawn draw against live humans, the fan geometry.
- `src/Session/SpectateHandoff.cs`, the shared pane handoff for a downed pilot whose teammates fly on: the wreck pinned, a spectator camera in the freed pane.
- `src/Session/ScriptedPathVehicles.cs`, one mission's scripted-path vehicles: the snap onto waypoint 0, the freeze, `START_TAXI`'s release, the handoff back.
- `src/Session/SurfaceVehicleRuntime.cs`, builds and steps a mission's `mode ship` hulls: a library-root copy placed on the water, indexed on the runtime.
- `src/Session/SurfaceVehicle.cs`, one built hull: the scripted-path follower over its patrol net, the wake and injure anims, and the pool a hit reaches.
- `src/Session/SurfaceGunner.cs`, a hull's own gun: the non-jet acquisition, the 20 s target hold, the mount, and the fire decision on the def's authored tuple.
- `src/Session/CampaignRoster.cs`, the engine-free plan of a campaign mission's `aiv` roster: each block's airframe, and its net or its netless escort.
- `src/Session/GeneratorCycle.cs`, the decoded egen launch timing law for one generator, pure and engine-free: composed periods, hold-not-cancel, the credit.
- `src/Session/NetTrailerTargets.cs`, resolves a patrol net's trailer name (`player`, a zeppelin) to a live position, so an anchored net rides its target.
- `src/Session/AiGeneratorRuntime.cs`, runs a mission's egen generators (`--generators`): the load drops, the cycle stepping, each launch's spawn or release.
- `src/Session/AiVoiceRuntime.cs`, wires the combat-voice dispatcher into a session: the speakers, the damage sources, the sites each clip plays from and the Voice bus it plays on.
- `src/Session/ZeppelinRuntime.cs`, runs a mission's zeppelins (`--zeppelins`): the placement, the net flight, the per-part damage and kill, the script's arms.
- `src/Session/ZeppelinRuntime.Cannons.cs`, the broadside half of that partial: the cannon wiring, the target and arc gate, the anims and the rounds fired.
- `src/Session/TurretEmplacementRuntime.cs`, the world AA emplacements: placed against the built world, in the shared aim pool, stepped after the airships.
- `src/Session/CampaignProfileStore.cs`, JSON persistence for one named campaign profile: funds, owned planes, mission records, awards and the destruction log.
- `src/Session/CampaignProgression.cs`, the rules that write a profile: an attempt's best-of merge, the monotonic position, the rewards and the skip offer.
- `src/Session/ChapterCinema.cs`, which film plays before a campaign chapter, when it plays, and the single handoff to the passenger cabin that follows it.
- `src/Session/ClosingCinema.cs`, whether the campaign's closing film plays before the scrapbook a flown mission opens, and the single handoff to that book.
- `src/Session/CampaignPersistLog.cs`, the cross-mission state log: what a mission left destroyed, carried silently into later missions of the same chapter.
- `src/Session/CampaignLoadout.cs`, the bridge between a profile's stored ammunition and ordnance picks and the `LoadoutChoice` a launch hands the session.
- `src/Session/ObjectiveScript.cs`, one mission's parsed `objectives.zrd`: the contiguous `OBJECTIVEn` blocks, in the typed shape the graph runs.
- `src/Session/ObjectiveGraph.cs`, the objectives runtime, engine-free: the four-state machine, the rotating completion scan, the conditions, the four endings.
- `src/Session/CampaignHumanField.cs`, the human field's rules, engine-free: what a condition naming one aeroplane asks once two to four humans fly.
- `src/Session/ObjectiveSites.cs`, the flown campaign mission's flagged target sites as targeting candidates, rebuilt from their live source every frame.
- `src/Session/CampaignDirector.cs`, the engine side of a campaign mission: the graph armed against the built world, the roster spawned and launched off its hooks, the attempt recorded.
- `src/Session/CampaignDangerZones.cs`, a campaign mission's own danger zones: the `dzpathN` gates its script arms, tracked per human by the stunt gate rule.
- `src/Session/AirframeSwap.cs`, the three `CALLBACK` codes that hand the player a different airframe in mid mission, and the def and node each names.
- `src/Session/CutsceneController.cs`, the host a cutscene definition raises its `CALLBACK` codes to, and the session state those codes describe.
- `src/Session/LandingApproachRuntime.cs`, the mid-mission cutscene trigger: `landings.zrd` rows tested against each flying human, and the auto-land offer.
- `src/Session/LadderSwitch.cs`, the rope-ladder switch as an engine-free rule and state machine, plus the co-op holder rule deciding which human owns it.
- `src/Session/LadderSwitchRuntime.cs`, that switch flown against the built world: the per-human attitude and sensor read, and the definitions it starts.

### `src/Bindings/`, the input binding model

What a binding is, how one resolves against hardware, and the named actions a polling site asks
for. The registry that turns a device identity into a live pad and the map that holds the actions
both sit on top of these types.

- `src/Bindings/DeviceId.cs`, which device a binding is on, as a value: the one keyboard, the one mouse, or a joypad named by its stable hardware string.
- `src/Bindings/BindingControl.cs`, the tagged control: a key, a button, a mouse button, one signed half of an axis past a deadzone, or one hat direction.
- `src/Bindings/Binding.cs`, one control on one named device, plus `ControlValue`, the held/how-far pair every resolution returns.
- `src/Bindings/IDeviceState.cs`, the tick's raw hardware state addressed by device identity; the seam that keeps resolution engine-free.
- `src/Bindings/GodotDeviceState.cs`, the live `IDeviceState` over Godot's `Input` singleton, resolving an identity to an index through a `DeviceRegistry`.
- `src/Bindings/DeviceRegistry.cs`, the joypad index-to-identity table, rebuilt from the connected-pad list rather than trusting an index across a replug.
- `src/Bindings/SeatDeviceState.cs`, the `IDeviceState` a seat reads: the platform's keyboard and mouse, plus the seat's pad set behind a placeholder.
- `src/Bindings/BindingSet.cs`, the bindings one action holds, ORed the way the original ORs its four slots, the deepest deflection winning the analogue read.
- `src/Bindings/InputAction.cs`, the enum of named actions, one per binding a polling site holds, contiguous because the snapshot indexes arrays by it.
- `src/Bindings/ActionMap.cs`, one player's keymap: which control fires which action, with assignment taking a control off every action that held it.
- `src/Bindings/ControlCapture.cs`, what a rebinding screen may capture, and the release-first scan that turns a press into a binding on the seat's identity.
- `src/Bindings/ICaptureDevices.cs`, the hardware a capture reads through: one reader per context, with the pad identity that context's bindings sit on.
- `src/Bindings/SeatCaptureDevices.cs`, one seat's capture readers, a `SeatDeviceState` per context over one pad list, on that context's placeholder identity.
- `src/Bindings/BindingLabels.cs`, what a rebinding screen prints: an action's name, a control's keycap name, and a row that counts what it is not showing.
- `src/Bindings/ActionSnapshot.cs`, the tick's resolved values, so two consumers reading one action in one tick get the same answer. No edges and no history.
- `src/Bindings/PlayerActions.cs`, the seam a polling site holds: a map, the tick's snapshot, and the pad-only keyboard gate for splitscreen players.
- `src/Bindings/InputContext.cs`, which set of controls a seat is reading (flight, menu, camera), because one control means different things per mode.
- `src/Bindings/DefaultBindings.cs`, the shipped keymap as data, one map per context, reproducing `docs/controls.md`, and the placeholder a pad default uses.
- `src/Bindings/BindingProfile.cs`, one seat's whole input: a map and a `PlayerActions` per context, plus the keyboard gate that applies to all of them.
- `src/Bindings/ActiveDevice.cs`, which side of a seat's hardware produced its last real input, and which of an action's bindings a prompt on that side names.
- `src/Bindings/BindingStore.cs`, the versioned JSON keymap file, one per player under `user://`, falling back per action to the shipped default.
- `src/Bindings/LaunchBindings.cs`, where a seat's keymap comes from when the seat is built: the player's saved file, or the shipped defaults.

### `src/Video/`, the MPEG-1 cinema decoder

The managed decoder for the install's ten `.mpg` files, from the container down to pixels and PCM.
It holds no engine type, so it runs in a plain unit test; formats and evidence are in
[`formats/cinemas.md`](formats/cinemas.md).

- `src/Video/MpegMovie.cs`, one cinema opened from its own bytes: the file's declared parameters, the next picture and the next block of sound.
- `src/Video/MpegSystemStream.cs`, the system-stream demultiplexer: each elementary stream joined into one buffer, with the audio packets and their timestamps kept.
- `src/Video/MpegVideoDecoder.cs`, the video decoder: sequence, picture, slice and macroblock, yielding frames in display order on the container's clock.
- `src/Video/MpegAudioDecoder.cs`, the layer II decoder: frame header, bit allocation, scale factors and requantisation, yielding 1152 samples per channel at a time.
- `src/Video/MpegBitReader.cs`, the bit reader every symbol is read through: bit fields, alignment, start-code scanning, the variable-length code walk.
- `src/Video/VideoVlcTables.cs`, the video variable-length code tables as data, each a flattened binary tree walked one bit at a time.
- `src/Video/AudioLayer2Tables.cs`, the layer II tables as data: the header's rates, the four-step lookup to a bit allocation table, and the quantisers it selects.
- `src/Video/DctBlock.cs`, the 8x8 block: scan order, the default quantiser matrices, dequantisation, and the integer inverse transform.
- `src/Video/AudioSubbandSynthesis.cs`, one channel's polyphase synthesis filter bank: 32 subband samples in, 32 PCM samples out, over a 1024-sample history.
- `src/Video/MotionCompensation.cs`, half-pel motion-compensated prediction of one macroblock of one plane, written or averaged into the current picture.
- `src/Video/VideoFrame.cs`, one decoded picture: three 4:2:0 planes, its presentation time, and the BT.601 conversion to RGBA.
- `src/Video/AudioFrame.cs`, one decoded sound frame: 1152 interleaved samples per channel as floats, and the moment the first of them is heard.
- `src/Video/MoviePlayback.cs`, a movie on a clock: the picture due now as RGBA, timed by the frames' own timestamps, looping endlessly on a play count of zero.
- `src/Video/CinemaPlayback.cs`, a cinema playing with its sound: clamped PCM out, the picture clocked by what the device has played, the two streams' start times taken against each other.

### Session root and tests

- `src/Pads.cs`, single owner of "which gamepads exist": the phantom-device policy, the launch-time roster split, the focus gate and `--no-pads`.
- `src/SessionPaths.cs`, resolves the extracted-data paths (per-chapter gamez/texture/zrdr, per-mission zrdr) under a data root, unpacked folder or `.zip`.
- `src/SessionSpec.cs`, the launch args as one immutable, engine-free value: `Parse` parses **and** resolves, plus the pure arg parsers the tests reach.

- `CSVM.Tests/`, the xUnit project (`dotnet test`): engine-free reader units on hand-authored fixtures + `extracted/` golden counts, skipped when absent; plus eight former in-engine suites moved here as `Probes.*`/plain-static/`StuntMission`/`GaugeCluster` facts.

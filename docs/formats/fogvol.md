# Fog volumes: `fogvol.zrd` + the gamez `fvol*` boxes

Part of the [format documentation](README.md). Covers the chapter-scope reader that fills the
world's invisible fog volumes with cloud sprites, the original's ambient cloud field.
Consumed by `CSVM/src/Mech3/FogVolumes.cs` (reader + volume census + the in-volume whiteout rule,
`FogVolumeWhiteout`), `CSVM/src/Effects/FogVolumeClutter.cs` (the scatter and the render) and
`CSVM/src/Session/WeatherRig.cs` (the whiteout overlay). Which key reaches which consumer:
[Consumed by the remake](#consumed-by-the-remake). What the original's own scatter and card draw do
with these keys, decoded from the executable, is [`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md).

**The format is two halves that only mean something together.** The reader says *what* to
scatter and *how densely*; the gamez says *where*. Neither alone tells you a chapter has clouds:
three chapters ship a reader file and no volumes, and their reader file names a template their
gamez does not carry.

## Reader data

One chapter-scope reader file, root = an [alternating key/list dict](README.md#shared-conventions-zrdr-readers).

| Key | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `fog_zone` | `[int]` | **A bool**: non-zero arms the engine's in-volume whiteout + `ZONE3` camera state, see [the decompile section](#what-the-engine-does-with-the-volumes). Consumed by the reader and weather runtime |
| `distance` | `[float]` | The scatter's mean spacing, metres, an areal density, not a lattice phase. Engine default **206.25** |
| `fog_fade_dist` | `[float]` | *(C5 only, **16**)* whiteout approach ramp, metres before the volume wall. Engine default **400**. Consumed |
| `interior_fog_fade_dist` | `[float]` | *(C5 only, **16**)* whiteout decay depth inside the volume. Engine default **20**. Consumed |
| `fog_color` | `[r,g,b]` | *(C5 only, **[16,16,16]**, near black)* the whiteout's colour, integer 0–255. Engine default: the mission's `CLOUD_COVER` `TOP_COLOR`. Consumed |
| `clutter` | `[block, …]` | The scatter table, one or more blocks, each an alternating dict |

A `clutter` block:

| Key | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `weight` | `[float]` | This block's weight among the table's alternatives |
| `nodes` | `[[weight, name], …]` | The gamez clutter-template roots this block may place, with their own weights |
| `far_fade_range` | `[[a,b],[c,d]]` | **The two endpoints of a per-sprite fade band** (metres, start → gone). The engine draws one random `t` per placement and interpolates both pairs with it, so a sprite's band is `[a+t(c−a), b+t(d−b)]`; it never picks one of the two ([`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md)) |
| `perp_dist_range` | `[min,max]` | Offset perpendicular to the volume's horizontal plane (vertical metres) |
| `perturb_dist_range` | `[min,max]` | Displacement from the drawn point within that plane |
| `scale_range` | `[min,max]` | Multiplier on the template sprite's own authored size |

⚠ **C1B, C2 and C3 ship a degenerate copy**: no `fog_zone`, no `clutter` key, the block sits in
the root list with nothing in front of it, which `ZrdrDict.FromAlternating` drops as a stray
value. `FogVolumeSpec.Parse` reads it anyway, on purpose: those three name a template
(`cloudsprite`, no digit) that **exists in no chapter's gamez**, so reading the block is what
lets "this chapter renders no clouds" be a proven lookup failure rather than a parser choice.
Their ranges are degenerate too (`perp_dist_range [151.25, 151.25]`), which is the second sign
the file is vestigial.

## GameZ volume nodes

Every chapter that scatters anything carries `fvol1`…`fvol34`: parentless-in-effect volumes
directly under the `World` node, each with its own model of 8–56 vertices, invisible (the world
walk has always skipped them, `WorldBuilder.SkipWorldNode`, now via `IsFogVolumeNode`, which the
volume census shares so the two sets cannot drift). **Their mesh is the volume**, not its
bounding box, which is the same thing only for C1/C2B/C4 (see the footprint entry below).

The correlation with half 1 is exact and is the whole decode:

| Chapter | `fvol*` | volume altitude band (m) | `distance` | `fog_zone` | templates named | sprites placed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 9 | 970 – 1090.5 | 130 | 0 | `cloudsprite1`, `cloudsprite2` | 10,524 |
| C1B | **0** | - | 206.25 | *(absent)* | `cloudsprite`, **absent from every gamez** | 0 |
| C1C | 21 | 970.7 – 1091.3, **+ 12 frusta reaching 1390–1688** | 130 | 0 | `cloudsprite1`, `cloudsprite2` | 11,452 |
| C2 | **0** | - | 206.25 | *(absent)* | `cloudsprite`, absent | 0 |
| C2B | 9 | 970 – 1090.5 | 130 | 0 | `cloudsprite1`, `cloudsprite2` | 10,524 |
| C3 | **0** | - | 206.25 | *(absent)* | `cloudsprite`, absent | 0 |
| C4 | 9 | 1060 – 1180.5 | 130 | 0 | `cloudsprite1`, `cloudsprite2` | 10,064 |
| C5 | 17 | −463 – 183 | 80 | 1 | `cloudsprite1`, `cloudsprite2` | 19,197 |

C1/C1C/C2B/C4's `fvol1`–`fvol9` tile the whole 12,288 m map as a single flat slab ~120 m thick,
and they are an **exact 3 × 3 partition of the `World` node's own `area`** (x and z each split at
−10240 and −2048 over [−12288, 0]), so the field's footprint *is* the base map, to the metre, with
no interior seam. The authored field DOES end at the base map's outer rim, "The map-edge
continuation" below continues it past there, engine-side, for these four chapters only.
**C1C additionally stacks twelve smaller volumes on top of that footprint**, reaching 1,688 m,
authored build-ups over particular places, and the reason the scatter fills *each* volume rather
than taking the first one that contains a cell. C5's are not a slab at all: seventeen
low strips at −463…183 m following the streets, which is why its clouds read as ground-level
night haze between the skyscrapers rather than as an overcast.

⚠ **The count a chapter carries is a property of its polygons, not of its volume geometry.** The
scatter lays its lattice over the faces the mesh authors and skips every polygon flagged
`no_clutter` (`0x800`), so a bigger or taller volume places nothing extra unless it authors more
unflagged surface. Every shipped `fvol` mesh is closed and carries that flag on its walls and
floor, which leaves the upward skin as the whole scatter surface in all five chapters.

⚠ **A fog volume is not the `CLOUD_COVER` band.** C1's floor (970) happens to equal its
`weather.json` `BOTTOM`, but C1C (band 1055–1110 vs volume 971–1091), C4 (1000–1100 vs
1060–1181) and C5 (9950–10150 vs −463–183) all disagree. The volumes are their own authored
geometry; do not re-derive them from the weather file.

## What the engine does with the volumes

Decompiled from `crimson.exe` (Ghidra; loader `FUN_0044e010`, volume evaluator `FUN_0044e6f0`,
per-frame consumer `FUN_0042ee40`, the same frame update that runs the `CLOUD_COVER` whiteout,
[weather.md](weather.md)). What the reader's keys actually drive:

- **The loader hides every world node whose name starts with `fvol`** (a 4-char prefix match)
  and wraps each in a volume record (transform + bounds), the same split this page decodes as
  "the mesh is the volume, invisible".
- **`fog_zone` is a bool arm-switch, not an index.** The loader stores `value != 0`; when set,
  every frame evaluates the camera against all volumes: approaching a wall, whiteout opacity
  ramps up linearly over the last `fog_fade_dist` metres; inside, it decays from full at the
  wall over `interior_fog_fade_dist` (the volume is a *transition* whiteout, ~20 m in it hands
  off); multiple volumes union as `a + b − a·b`. Being inside any volume flips the camera to
  **state 3 = `ZONE3`**, whose fog then carries the interior look. The install agrees to the
  letter: C5 is the only chapter authoring `fog_zone 1`, and the only one authoring a `ZONE3`
  (50–250 m fog) and its own `fog_color`/fade dists; C1's `fog_zone 0` leaves its nine deck
  volumes as scatter containers only, with no interior state, and C1 authors no `ZONE3`.
- **The whole load runs under a FIXED seed:** `srand(0x9b3a9ce2)` at entry, restored to
  `srand(time())` at exit, so every `rand()` the original's scatter draws is the same sequence
  every launch. The original's field is deterministic by construction (the remake's own seeded
  `Rng` reproduces the *property*, not the sequence).
- **The scatter itself is decoded**, in [`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md): the original
  scatters over the volume mesh's **faces**, polygon by polygon, on a staggered lattice of
  `distance × sqrt(3)/2` by `distance` in each polygon's own plane. That page also holds what the
  engine applies to a placed card, which is entirely alpha and nothing else.
- **The engine's defaults equal the "vestigial" C1B/C2/C3 values.** Absent keys default to
  `distance` 206.25, `far_fade_range` [2500,3500]×2, `perturb_dist_range` [82.5, 82.5],
  `perp_dist_range` [151.25, 151.25], `scale_range` [0.85, 1.15], the degenerate copies simply
  restate the hardcoded defaults, a third sign those files are boilerplate rather than authored.

## Map-edge continuation

⚠ **Everything above this section is what `fogvol.zrd` + the gamez author. This section is not
that.** The original's field reads as everywhere, past the map the way `cloudparent` does NOT
(`CAP-12`'s own caveat: `cloudparent` stops at the map edge; extending it would invent content,
the two populations' vocabulary is `BL-325`'s note). Neither
`fogvol.zrd` nor the gamez says anything about content past `World.area`, there is nothing to
decode here, only a deliberate engine-side match to the terrain's own continuation
(`MapEdgeExtender.cs`, docs/architecture.md), landed as `A5` (user playtest, : "it is
only over the basemap. in the original its everywhere").

**What extends, decided from data (`FogVolumeSpec.FindMapSpanningSlab`):** only the volumes that
are (1) axis-aligned boxes, (2) sheet-thin by `TopAnchorHeightFactor`, and (3), as a set, exactly
tile their own combined bounding rectangle with no gap or overlap, re-checking the "exact 3×3
partition of `World.area`" finding from the data rather than assuming it, so nothing keys off a
chapter name or an `fvol1..9` numbering convention. C1/C2B/C4's nine slab pieces and C1C's own
map-spanning `fvol1`–`fvol9` pass; C1C's twelve build-up frusta and C5's seventeen street strips
both fail test (2), the shortest build-up is 299.7 m (ratio 2.27 against the 1.5× cut) and the
shallowest strip is 646 m (ratio 9.23), so neither is ever extended.

**How far.** `MapEdgeExtender`'s rolling terrain window covers `Rings` (5) tiles of 1,024 m past
whatever cell the camera occupies, **5,120 m**, but a full precomputed ring to that radius would
place an estimated **~21,250** extra sprites for C1/C2B/C4 (≈2.0× the 10,524-sprite base field,
extrapolated from the ring-area ratio at the measured radius below), past a sane budget for a
structure that is built once and kept for the process's whole lifetime. Every kind's own shader
already collapses a sprite past its authored `far_fade.y` to a degenerate quad (`FogVolumeClutter`
class remarks), so a ring wider than the LARGEST authored `far_fade.y` buys zero visible pixels
from anywhere a camera can stand, bounding the extension there is lossless, not a cut corner.
The view-angle term the render now applies only tightens that bound: on the horizontal face these
rings continue, a sprite's horizontal reach is `sqrt(dy x far - dy^2)`, which peaks at `far/2`.
Both `cloudsprite1`/`cloudsprite2` carry the same **3,500 m** in every shipped deck chapter, so
today this is one radius per chapter, read from the data rather than hardcoded.

**Density, Y band, and determinism.** A `distance` × `distance` cell tiling (outermost cell of
each axis takes the remainder), same weighted kind draw, same `perturb_dist_range`/`scale_range`.
Y is the slab's own constant top (every qualifying piece's `box.End.Y`, checked equal by
`FindMapSpanningSlab`) plus `perp_dist_range`. ⚠ **The ring's own tiling is NOT the interior
lattice**: past the map there is no polygon to lay one on, so this is a square cell draw
continuing the slab's top face, a deliberate engine-side match and the one place the two
populations differ in layout. Each extension cell draws off its OWN generator,
`Rng.NewSystemRandom(Rng.Clouds, gx, gz)` (`Utils/Rng.cs`), a hash of the master seed, the
subsystem and the cell's own coordinates, not the interior's shared sequential stream, so the
extension is stable under `--det` regardless of how many cells the far-fade bound admits or what
order they build in, and the interior draw's own realization is untouched.

**Measured, all 8 chapters** (`--freecam --chapter=<X> --det`, `fogvol clouds:` log line):

| chapter | base (authored) | extension (engine-side) | total | extension/base |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 10,524 | 13,176 | 23,700 | 1.25× |
| C1B | 0 | 0 | 0 | - |
| C1C | 11,452 | 13,176 | 24,628 | 1.15× |
| C2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - |
| C2B | 10,524 | 13,176 | 23,700 | 1.25× |
| C3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | - |
| C4 | 10,064 | 13,176 | 23,240 | 1.31× |
| C5 | 19,197 | 0 | 19,197 | - |

The extension column is the same 13,176 in every chapter that has a map-spanning slab, and the
three deckless chapters stay at zero, so the extension is inert exactly where the data says it
must be, and additive only where such a slab exists. ⚠ **The ring continues the slab's top face
alone**, one authored polygon per piece rather than the volume, which is what the authored slab
carries anyway; a chapter whose slab ever authored a second unflagged face would need this rule
widened.

**Verified at the render.** A straight-down-the-seam pair at the west map rim
(`.scratch/a5/before-west-along-override.png` / `after-west-along-override.png`,
`--tex-override=cloud1.tif=00ff00 --tex-override=cloud2.tif=00ff00 --no-fog`): before, a hard
vertical line where dense green field meets bare white void; after, the same frame is green edge
to edge, no seam. The same pair at the map's NW corner and from 3,000 m past the west rim looking
back both show the identical before/after change (`.scratch/a5/*-corner-outward-override.png`,
`*-outside-lookback-override.png`), the void the "before" build shows past the rim is filled, not
just thinned. `--det` twice at an identical pose: `pixmd5=f49caae4b1c6c1f62bdde1af8229faa6` both
runs.

## The sprite templates

`cloudsprite1`/`cloudsprite2` are ordinary [clutter template roots](clutter.md), parentless
`Object3d` nodes resolved by name (`ClutterBuilder.FindTemplateRoot`, shared with the trees) with
one child carrying the card. The card is a single 4-vertex, 1-polygon tri-strip quad,
`model_type: Facade` + `facade_mode: SphericalY` (full camera-facing, not the trees' upright
`CylindricalY`), skinned `cloud1.tif` / `cloud2.tif`, vertex colours 240/240/240, centred on its
own quad centre to within 3 mm.

⚠ **We render those cards at the authored 240, and no colour term is applied to them at all.**
The card's colour reaches the vertex diffuse unchanged, the texture is a constant-RGB 239 alpha
mask, and the per-sprite draw distance is scaled by the cosine of the viewing angle against its
`fvol` polygon's normal ([`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md)). The measurements that a
colour scale once stood in for still hold, but the quantity they measure is COVERAGE:
`236.65 × 240/255 = 222.7` is what the naive reading gives, **nothing in five independent original
above-band frames renders at 222.7**, and the original's saturated plateau measures **208.88**
(`t124`, 1208 m) and **209.16** (`t59`, 1219 m) in a near-field, fog-free patch, with whole-frame
`p99` topping out at 213–216. A card cannot exceed `239 × 240/255 = 224.9`, so 209 is the fogged
background showing through a field that the viewing angle has thinned to a disc at exactly those
grazing poses. Four mechanisms that could have explained it as a colour were refuted on data:
(1) no `cloudsprite` `OBJECT_OPACITY_STATE` exists in any chapter's `zrdr`, C1's `clouds.zrd`
names only `cloudparent`, and no other chapter ships one; (2) `WorldLight` on C1's cards would put
them at 178.6, *below* the original's own 204.9–213.3 at the matching altitude; (3) `fog: true` is
contradicted three ways (the same reader's tree templates and the world's placed cloud facades
both author it explicitly, and `B16` verified the flag is honoured); (4) carrying the field up
with the relocated deck is refuted by CAP-12's own altimetry. ⚠ **Do not re-introduce a colour
scale here.** The placed `cloudparent` facades are a separate population and keep vertex colour 255
and their range-gated `0.6` opacity.

| Chapter | card size | `lighting` | `fog` |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1, C4 | 132.3 × 132.3 m | `false` | `false` |
| C1C, C2B | 132.3 × 132.3 m | `true` | `false` |
| C5 | 70.0 × 70.0 m | `true` | `false` |

⚠ **`lighting: true` admits a per-vertex directional term, not a brightness scalar.** The card
carries three authored normals (`normal_indices [1, 1, 0, 2]`, the top two corners sharing the one
that runs up the card and the bottom two the pair that points out of it), the billboard basis turns
them with the camera, and the original evaluates `AMBIENT + DIFFUSE × max(N·L, 0)` per vertex on
them. So a lit card is shaded across its face and swings with the heading, where the remake applies
one flat `csky_world_light`; the decode and what it implies are in
[`../org/vertexLighting.md`](../org/vertexLighting.md).

⚠ Every card is authored `fog: false`, the sprites are exempt from the mission distance fog and
carry `far_fade_range` instead. That is a deliberate reversal of what `CloudPuffs` did (it fogged
its puffs); the fade band replaces the fog wall.

⚠ **The exemption is the CARDS' alone, do not extend it to the rest of the overcast**. The 144
cloud-deck tiles author `fog: true` in all four deck chapters (144/144, C1/C1C/C2B `cloudlayer.tif`
@ 960, C4 `Sky1.tif` @ 1050), and so do all 626/1056/1453 `cloudparent` facades in C1/C1C/C4. The
surface that genuinely never fogs below the deck is the horizon **dome**, every horizon model in
every chapter is `fog: false`, which is what actually explains the original's ceiling texture
surviving to the horizon line (census and consequences in [`weather.md`](weather.md)'s deck-census section).

## What is decoded and what is inferred

**Decoded, traced to data:** which templates and their weights; the volumes and their **authored
shapes**, not merely their extents; **the scatter surface**, the mesh's own polygons minus every
one flagged `no_clutter`; the staggered lattice laid in each polygon's plane; the per-sprite scale
range; the draw distances; the card geometry, texture, billboard mode and render flags; and the
three-chapter split, which four independent absences agree on (no `fvol*`, no `cloudsprite*`
template, no `clutter` key, degenerate ranges).

**Inferred, and marked as such:**

- ~~**The polygon normal a sprite's draw distance is scaled against, for a volume that is not a
  slab.**~~ **Struck: the scatter lays its lattice on each authored polygon, so a sprite's normal
  is its own face's**, exact in every chapter including C1C's build-up frusta and C5's street
  prisms. The law itself is decoded ([`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md)) and applied:
  each placement carries that normal and its own draw of the fade band.
  ⚠ The card's `lighting` flag is not part of this and is decoded rather than open: it gates the
  sun on a facade exactly as it does on any model, but what it admits is a per-vertex
  `AMBIENT + DIFFUSE × max(N·L, 0)` evaluated on the card's own three authored normals carried
  through the billboard basis, never a flat `WorldLight` multiply
  ([`../org/vertexLighting.md`](../org/vertexLighting.md)'s facade section). C1 and C4, whose
  footage the 208.8 plateau was measured in, author `lighting: false`, so no lighting term reaches
  their cards at all.
- **`distance` is the scatter's mean spacing, an areal density.** It is also the decoded lattice's
  column step, and the two readings agree: the staggered lattice puts one placement every
  `distance² × sqrt(3)/2` of face area, with `perturb_dist_range` applied on top. The density is
  what the number is for and it is corroborated twice over: C1's 10,524 placements over the
  12,288 m map are a mean spacing of **119.8 m**, against the **121.0 m** the lattice itself
  predicts (`sqrt(130 × 130 × sqrt(3)/2)`), and a mean card area of
  132.3² × E[scale²] gives **1.9 sprite-areas of cover** per unit of layer, an overcast one sprite
  deep. A lattice rather than N uniform draws over the whole footprint, because a Poisson field at
  this density opens holes and an overcast has to read as continuous.
  ☑ **Landed `A2`, and confirmed at the render.** The previous reading, that the
  number was a *grid phase*, with `perturb_dist_range` as jitter on it, was contradicted by
  `PT-42` + `CAP-12` (ours combed on the 130 m lattice at grazing angles; the original shows none
  at any angle) and is now gone from the code. Mean spacing is invariant under the randomisation,
  so the density corroboration above only ever supported the *spacing*, never the *regularity*.
  The A2 A/B that settles it is a straight-down pair over C5's harbour, where the sprites read
  against dark water: before, blobs in aligned rows and columns at a fixed pitch; after, an
  irregular scatter with clumps and gaps at the same count.
  **Unbounded camera-tiling, the other candidate correction, is *falsified*, not merely
  unsupported**: the reader carries **no altitude field at all**, so the measured deck heights can
  only come from the `fvol` geometry, and a mechanism that reads a volume's Y bounds while
  discarding its X/Z bounds is two mechanisms; C5's seventeen polygonal street prisms (38 % of its
  map) and C1C's twelve rotated, tapering build-up frusta are inexpressible in a camera-centred
  field. **And its `templates.zrd` premise is wrong on the data:** that file carries only
  `node` / `substitute` / `scale_range` / `far_fade_range`, **no `distance`, no
  `perturb_dist_range`**, its period is the template's gamez ground-quad size and its decoration
  offsets are authored one-by-one, with no randomness anywhere. The genuinely shared keys are
  `scale_range`, `far_fade_range` and weighted substitution.
  ⚠ `PT-42`(b)'s "world-locked and tiled, no volume edge anywhere over the base map" is **not**
  evidence against the bounded reading, the nine slab volumes ARE the map (see half 2), so the
  two readings can only differ within `far_fade_range.y` (3500 m) of the map boundary and the
  footage never samples that.
- **The per-volume reference point the `perp_dist_range` offset runs away from.** The decode has
  the direction (`unit(p − ref)`, from a point the volume record carries to the sample point) but
  not where in the record that point is read, so the remake uses the volume's bounds centre. On a
  slab's top face that gives up near the middle tilting outward towards the rim, which is also why
  the older "`perp_dist_range` is vertical" reading held for the deck chapters: the asymmetry it
  rested on (`cloudsprite1` `[-5, 5]` against `cloudsprite2` `[-5, 10]`, one kind floating higher)
  is what the centre-outward direction produces there. A different reference point would tilt the
  offsets, not resize them ([`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md)).
- ~~**`far_fade_range[1]` is what to draw at**, the pair being per detail level.~~ **Struck: the
  decode says the two pairs are the endpoints of a per-sprite interpolation** and the engine never
  selects one of them ([`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md)). The render applies the
  interpolation: each placement carries one draw `t` and its band is `mix(far_fade_0, far_fade_1, t)`.
  The detail level enters somewhere else entirely, as a factor of 1, 4 or 9 on the squared distance,
  which is the graphics `EffectsLevel` and reaches the shader as `csky_clutter_fade_scale_sq`.
- ~~**The vertical spread is TOP-ANCHORED for sheet-thin volumes, UNIFORM for tall ones, the
  anchor IS per-volume-shape.**~~ **Struck: there is no vertical rule to choose, because the
  scatter never fills a volume's interior.** The lattice lies on the authored polygons, and every
  shipped `fvol` mesh flags its walls and floor `no_clutter`, so the field is the upward skin of
  each volume and its Y comes from the polygon it sits on. What the top-anchored reading was
  built to explain survives intact: C4's clear air at 1135 m (`CAP-12` C4 take) falsified a
  uniform fill, since 132.3 m cards drawn uniformly across the 1060–1180.5 volume would hang to
  ~956 m, leaving no gap, but the clip shows *clear sky*, puff bases well above the 1050 m deck
  sheet. On C4's slab the skin IS the top, so the two readings agree there and the clip still
  discriminates against a fill.
  ⚠ **`TopAnchorHeightFactor` (1.5× the chapter's card size) survives as the map-edge
  continuation's sheet test alone**, deciding which volumes the ring may continue, and is a
  judgement call rather than authored data. It reads off a clean gap in the volumes' own measured
  thickness (`extracted/{C1,C1C,C2B,C4,C5}/gamez/nodes.json`): C1/C2B/C4's nine slabs and C1C's
  own map-spanning `fvol1`–`fvol9` are **120.5–120.6 m** thick against a 132.3 m card (ratio
  0.91); C1C's twelve build-up frusta start at **299.7 m** (ratio 2.27, the shortest of them) and
  reach 596.8 m; C5's seventeen street strips are **646 m** (ratio 9.23 against their 70 m card).
  1.5× card height (198.5 m for the 132.3 m chapters) sits in that gap with margin on both sides,
  39 % under the tallest slab, 51 % under the shortest build-up, so no shipped volume is a close
  call.
  - **C1's band is still a degenerate instrument on its own** (`CLOUD_COVER` `TOP 1124 / BOTTOM
    970 / THICKNESS 30` predicts full white 1000–1094; the slab predicts a 1090.55 m top; the
    measurement is 1003–1085 m and both fit), **C4's 1135 m clear-air frame remains the clean
    discriminator**, and the render now reproduces it (below).
  - ⚠ **The deck mesh is the slab's floor, authored: every deck chapter puts its `CloudDeck`
    tiles ~10 m BELOW its `fvol1`–`fvol9` slab floor** (from each gamez's
    `model_bbox`). The invariant, all four:

    | chapter | deck tiles | `fvol1`–`fvol9` floor | gap | `CLOUD_COVER` centre |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | C1 | 960.0 | 970.00 | 10.00 | 1047.0 |
    | C1C | 960.0 | 970.73 | 10.73 | 1082.5 |
    | C2B | 960.0 | 970.00 | 10.00 | 1024.0 |
    | C4 | 1050.0 | 1060.00 | 10.00 | **1050.0** |

    So the two populations are ONE sheet in the data: mesh underneath, sprite field on the slab's
    own top face above it, and the field's altitude only reads correctly against the mesh at its
    authored altitude. C4's centre lands on its authored deck exactly, which is the corroboration
    and also why C4 never showed the `A6` defect.

    ⚠ **The authored altitude is where the data puts the sheet; it is NOT where the deck mesh is
    rendered**. The original's deck is engine trickery, below the
    `CLOUD_COVER` centre a ceiling carried 400 m above the camera, above it a world-fixed floor at
    the centre, so `WeatherRig.Tick` places it at neither chapter's authored 960/1050. What the
    table above still decides is the **relationship** the scatter is read against (mesh 10 m under
    the slab floor, one sheet) and the fact that `A6`'s band-centre pin was wrong *in the
    below-band regime*, where it buried the deck inside the field. Above the band that same pin is
    what the original does, and A7 restores it there.
  - **Verified at the render, `--pos`/`--tex-override` probes in `.scratch/a3/`:**
    - **C1 river pose** (`x -7325 y 934 z -3829`, ⚠ **not** the twin's altitude: `A7` re-read
      `Screenshots/C1 IA1 Fog river.png`'s overlay in and it says **`y 192`**, which the
      original's ALT gauge corroborates at ~700–750 ft. This probe is a self-consistent
      before/after pair at 934 m and its conclusion stands; a matched-pose A/B against the
      original needs 192): before, discrete cauliflower lumps hang below the deck sheet with a
      hard lower boundary (`before-river-pose.png`); after, the sheet's underside reads clean with
      the cloud band sitting well above it (`after-river-pose.png`).
      ⚠ **`A3`'s `--tex-override` numbers at this pose were misread, and `A6` them, do not re-cite them as written.** ~~looking straight up shows **zero** sprite pixels
      (`after-river-override-up.png`); levelled and tilted up, the coloured field's lower edge sits
      well clear of a flat gray band (the deck mesh at y=960) with no green intrusion at all
      (`after-river-override-level.png`)~~. Both readings measured something else. (a) A
      `cloudsprite` card is a `Facade`/`SphericalY` billboard, so from *directly* below it is
      **edge-on**, "zero green looking straight up" is a fact about billboard orientation and
      carries no altitude information at all. (b) The deck was NOT at 960 m at the time: `WeatherRig.Tick`
      re-pinned it to the `CLOUD_COVER` band centre, **1047 m**, and the big pale surface filling
      `after-river-override-level.png` IS that deck, the green fringe is drawn *over* it, i.e.
      below it. The "flat gray band" A3 identified as the deck is the dome seen under the deck's
      far edge. Re-shot with the deck itself flattened (`--tex-override=cloudlayer.tif=ff0000`,
      `.scratch/a6/`): **85,507 green pixels over red before, 0 after** the `A6` fix.
    - **C4 clear-air pose** (`x -4974 y 1135 z -3861`, the `csvm-c4-1135m.png` altitude): a
      level `--tex-override` sweep shows patchy, non-solid coverage at 1135 m, consistent with
      the predicted card-bottom band topping out at 1127.7 m, 7 m below this altitude, against
      **fully solid** coverage from the same pose 85 m lower at 1050 m, inside the predicted
      986–1128 m band (`after-c4-1135m-override-level.png` vs `after-c4-1050m-override-level.png`).
    - **C1C's build-ups and C5's street prisms read as a SHELL, not a filled mass**, which is the
      visible signature of the lattice lying on the polygons. A C5 volume seen from 894 m with
      `--no-fog` and both cards overridden to one colour goes from cards scattered through the
      prism's depth to a single dense sheet at its top, 428,921 px moved of 921,600 with 3 px
      outside the population's own two-colour mask.
    - **Sky→tops transition depth (the `A2`-amended instrument) does NOT move materially at any
      of the four poses tested** (pinned above-deck 46/13→46/7, grazing-tops-1208 60/47.5→55/48,
      above-deck-1527 25/25→25/25, high-above-1698 24/24→24/24, band/edge px). This is a genuine
      finding, not a forced non-result: a billboard card is itself 132.3 m across, so a slab
      chapter's field is one card deep however its Y is chosen, and the instrument reads how
      ragged the *silhouette* of the nearest cards is at a shallow viewing angle, which no
      vertical rule touches. **The remaining gap to the original's 91–103 px
      is therefore NOT primarily a vertical-placement problem**; it is left as a finding for a
      future item (candidates: per-card alpha softness/scale distribution, or a video-compression
      artifact in the `CAP-12` capture, untraced, not investigated here).
- ~~**The volume is its axis-aligned bounding box.**~~ **Struck: the volume is the authored
  mesh**, and the two agree only for C1/C2B/C4. `FogVolumeSpec.VolumesOf` carries each volume's
  face planes and its unflagged polygons beside its bounds, and `FogVolumeBox.Contains` is a
  half-space test over the planes, **exact, not an approximation, because every one of the 65
  shipped `fvol*` volumes is convex** (verified across all eight chapters: slabs, frusta and
  street prisms alike). The camera-state test and the whiteout use that; the scatter uses the
  polygons, testing each lattice point against its own polygon's outline rather than against the
  volume.
  - C1/C2B/C4's slabs are boxes (hull/AABB = 1.000) authoring one unflagged top polygon each, so
    their nine faces carry the whole field.
  - **C1C's twelve build-ups are rotated *frusta*.** Footprints 2048 × 704 m (also 974 × 335,
    1864 × 641, 854 × 294), the same twelve shapes cut into `fvol9`'s own top face as coplanar
    polygons; `fvol10` is 854 × 294 m at its 1091.28 m base and ~464 × 160 m at its 1688.05 m top.
    They are the chapter's only sloped scatter surface, 1,242 sprites of 11,452.
  - **C5's seventeen strips are polygonal prisms**, each with a flat top at 183 m over a floor at
    −463 m; volume fractions 0.558–1.000, and only `fvol1`/`fvol3` are boxes. The other fifteen
    carry one to five sloped rim faces each, 29 in all, climbing from 37 m to that top at about 37°
    off the horizontal; they hold 2,102 sprites of 19,197, the flat tops the other 17,095. What the
    fade law makes of that shape, measured per altitude, is in
    [`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md).
  - Because the lattice sits on the polygon it belongs to, a taper needs no vertical rule taught
    about it: the sloped face is simply a face, and its sprites carry its own normal.

**Undecoded / not implemented:**

- ~~**`fog_zone`, and C5's `fog_color` / `fog_fade_dist` / `interior_fog_fade_dist`** are read and
  reported and nothing in the remake consumes them yet.~~ **Struck: all four keys
  are now CONSUMED, see [Consumed by the remake](#consumed-by-the-remake) below.**
- ⚠ **`fog_zone` is not the sky/fog zone selector**, and as of it is no longer
  unidentified: the decompile (section above) shows it is a **bool** arming the in-volume
  whiteout and the `ZONE3` camera state. The old record stands as history: the archived development log
  claimed "no chapter's copy has a `fog_zone` key", wrong, five do, and the
  `zone_id` mismatches that blocked the "selector" reading (C1's 0 against `zone_id: 2`) were
  never a contradiction, because the value was never an index. `BL-277`'s geometry rule stands
  as landed.
- ~~**The engine's exact cell phase**, the remake anchoring its cells on the world origin.~~
  **Struck: the lattice layout is decoded and implemented**
  ([`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md)). The lattice lies in each `fvol` **polygon's**
  own plane, anchored on that polygon's projected minimum corner, basis `U = unit(v1 − v0)` and
  `V = U × n`, steps `distance × sqrt(3)/2` and `distance` cut into whole steps, every other row
  offset half a step, each point tested against the polygon's own outline. The density reading it
  was chosen under is unaffected.
- **The map-edge continuation's radius is a TUNE, like `TopAnchorHeightFactor`.** `A5`
  bounds the extension to the largest authored `far_fade.y` (3,500 m, every shipped deck chapter)
  rather than to `MapEdgeExtender`'s own reach (5,120 m), a budget decision matched to the
  render's own fade shader, not a value `fogvol.zrd` or the gamez names. See the section above.

## Consumed by the remake

| key | who reads it | since |
|---|---|---|
| `distance`, `clutter` (all sub-keys) | `Effects/FogVolumeClutter`, the scatter | `A1`–`A5` |
| the gamez `fvol*` shapes | `FogVolumeSpec.VolumesOf` → the scatter, `MapEdgeExtender`, the camera-state test | `A1`/`A2` |
| **`fog_zone`** | `FogVolumeSpec.FogZoneArmed` → `WeatherState.CameraWeatherState`'s state-3 gate | |
| **`fog_fade_dist`, `interior_fog_fade_dist`, `fog_color`** | `Mech3.FogVolumeWhiteout` → `Session/WeatherRig.Tick`'s whiteout overlay | |

**`C21` landed the in-volume whiteout exactly as the section above decodes it.** Per
frame, per rig, when the chapter arms `fog_zone` (C5 alone), every volume's own density is taken
from one signed distance (`FogVolumeBox.SignedDistance`, outside-positive, inside-negative) through
the two decompiled ramps, and the volumes union as `a + b − a·b`:

- **outside**, the density rises linearly from 0 at `fog_fade_dist` metres to 1 AT the wall, over
  the true Euclidean distance to the authored convex hull (`FogVolumeBox.ExteriorDistance`, the
  face planes alone understate it by up to 42 % near a corner);
- **inside**, it DECAYS from 1 at the wall to 0 at `interior_fog_fade_dist` metres deep. ⚠ Read
  that next to `C22`, not on its own: the volume is a transition CURTAIN and `ZONE3`'s own 50–250 m
  fog is what carries the interior look. Inverting it would be wrong.

The result is blended onto the same full-screen overlay the `CLOUD_COVER` band whiteout uses (one
camera-space density per frame, never per-volume fog meshes, the original's own mechanism). The
two sources union with the same `a + b − a·b`, with the volume curtain composited OVER the band;
**they never coexist in shipped data**, C5 is the only chapter arming `fog_zone` and its band sits
at 9950–10150 m, ~9.8 km above its highest street strip.

⚠ **C5's "whiteout" is very nearly a BLACKOUT.** Its authored `fog_color` is `[16,16,16]`, the
same 16 its `ZONE3` `FOG_COLOR` carries, so the hand-off to `C22` is colour-continuous, and its
two fade distances are **16 m each**, not the engine defaults (400/20). At flight speed that
approach ramp is roughly one frame; the curtain is a hard edge by authoring, not by our
implementation.

Measured at the render (`.scratch/c21/`, `--freecam --chapter=C5 --det --no-zone-cull`, a vertical
approach at `(-2000, y, -1792)` onto a street strip whose top is 183 m; "before" = the same build
with the volume term forced to 0, restored and rebuilt after):

| pose | density | frame mean before → after | predicted | frame sd |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `y 210` (27 m above, past the ramp) | 0.000 | 17.76 → 17.76, **byte-identical** | 17.76 | 18.38 → 18.38 |
| `y 191` (8 m above = half the ramp) | 0.500 | 18.53 → **17.29** | 17.26 | 18.84 → **9.54** |
| `y 182` (1 m inside the wall) | 0.937 | 17.85 → **16.06** | 16.12 | 5.08 → **0.33** |

The predictions are the sRGB-byte composite `(1−a)·frame + a·16`; a LINEAR-space composite predicts
18.22 at the half pose against the measured 17.29, so the overlay demonstrably blends in the
framebuffer's own space, which is what a `ColorRect` on a `CanvasLayer` does, and why this colour
is NOT linearised the way the fog globals are. The interior frame's sd of **0.33** is the
"near-full whiteout in `fog_color`" claim measured: at 1 m in, the frame is flat 16.

A C1 river pose (`fog_zone` 0) is **byte-identical** across the same A/B, and all 13 goldens are
hash-identical, including `c5-city-night`, whose camera stands **1,797.7 m** from the nearest C5
volume, 112× the 16 m ramp (predicted before the run, pinned in
`CSVM.Tests/FogVolumeWhiteoutTests.cs`).

## Visible consequences to know about

- **A SQUARE 130 m grid is not authored, a staggered one is.** A 10–20 m perturbation on a square
  130 m grid is ±15 % jitter and it combed at grazing angles, where the original (`CAP-12`
  t=44/59/97/124, t=29.2) shows soft continuous mottling at every angle. The decoded lattice is
  staggered (`distance × sqrt(3)/2` rows, alternate rows offset half a step) and lies in each
  polygon's own plane, so world-axis rows never form. Do not re-derive a square grid from
  `distance`.
- **The sky→tops transition-depth gap survived BOTH the horizontal fix and the vertical
  one, it is evidence for neither scatter axis.** `A2` measured 0–0.5 px of movement from
  randomising the horizontal placement (13 → 13.5 px at the pinned above-deck pose); `A3`'s
  top-anchoring moved the same four poses by 0–5 px, still nowhere near the original's 91–103 px
  (see the vertical-spread entry above for the per-pose numbers). A 132.3 m card is nearly as tall
  as the whole slab is thick, so even the OLD full-height-uniform draw already put a card near the
  volume's ceiling almost everywhere by sheer density, concentrating the draw into a tighter top
  band didn't change that. **Do not read this shallow transition as evidence about either the
  horizontal scatter or the Y-distribution rule**, whatever produces the original's soft band is
  still unidentified (candidates: per-card alpha falloff/scale distribution, or a capture artifact
  in the `CAP-12` video) and is a lead for a future item, not something either wave should keep
  chasing with placement changes.
- **A volume's interior is empty; the field is its skin.** C1C's build-ups and C5's street prisms
  read as a shell around a hollow shape rather than as a filled mass, because their walls and
  floors carry `no_clutter` and only the upward faces scatter. Anywhere a camera can get inside a
  C5 prism, the cards are overhead in one sheet and the air below them is clear, and the view-angle
  term then drops that sheet outright rather than showing it from below
  ([`../org/cloudCards.md`](../org/cloudCards.md)). Do not read a thin-looking interior, or an empty
  street-level frame, as a missing population.
- **Volume walls are not sprite clips.** `perturb_dist_range` is applied after containment, so a
  card's centre can sit up to `perturb_dist_range.y` outside its own volume's wall. That is what a
  perturbation means; the volume bounds where the field is placed, not where each sprite may hang.
- **The field no longer ends at the base map's rim, for the four map-spanning-slab chapters.**
  `A5`'s engine-side continuation (its own section above) fills the same void this document used to
  describe as "no edge anywhere a player can reach it", that phrase described the ABSENCE of
  interior seams between the nine slab pieces, which still holds; the map's OUTER rim used to be a
  real edge, and now is not, for C1/C1C/C2B/C4 only.

# Effects: `PUFFER_STATE` emitters, effect readers, flipbook textures

Part of the [format documentation](README.md). Covers the original's fully data-driven
effect system (the crash sequence and damage trails; no binary anim
format needed for any of it). Consumed by `CSVM/src/Effects/Puffer.cs`.

**This page is the authored side** — the keys, the files, the textures. What the original's
*runtime* does with them (the object and particle layouts, the constructor's defaults, the
integration order, the emission accumulator, the render equation) is decoded from the executable in
[`../org/puffer.md`](../org/puffer.md), which is outside this directory and its licence.

The system has three layers, all in zrdr + the chapter `texture.zbd`:

1. **Sequencing scripts** — `ANIMATION_DEFINITIONS` readers (`ai_plane_destruct.json`,
   `player_plane_destruct.json`) defining per-plane, surface-sensitive crash sequences
   (`player_crash_default`/`_dirt`/`_water`) that toggle model subtrees
   (healthy→destroyed), play named sounds at nodes, and `CALL_ANIMATION` into effect
   scripts. Schema in [anim-definitions.md](anim-definitions.md).
2. **Particle emitters** — `PUFFER_STATE` blocks (below) in `flame_ball.json` (16 states,
   e.g. `large_fireball`), `fire.json` (`fire_n_smoke` sustained wreck fire),
   `pufftrails.json` (`dense_firetrail` smoke/fire pair, `short_firetrail` panel trails),
   `flak_trails.json`, `zepskinfire.json`, plus inline states in vehicle anims (the
   train's steam in `train.json`).
3. **Flipbook textures** in the chapter `texture.zbd`: `fire_f01–06` (fireball),
   `fire101–112` (sustained fire), `smoke101–103`, `exp_yel01`/`exp_red01`/`exp_blu02`/
   `exp_gre01` (flash sprites), `fireflare1`.

The gamez effect-prototype nodes (`ball_of_fire`, `flak_explosion`, `dense_firetrail`,
`explode_here1–9`, …) are mostly empty parentless Object3d anchors the emitters attach
to at runtime — they are not world scenery (see [world-structure.md](world-structure.md)).

## Emitter schema

A state is a **fully-defined emitter iff it has `NUMBER` (burst) or `DISTANCE_INTERVAL`
(trail)**; the readers also hold *stop stubs* sharing the same `NAME` but carrying only
`ACTIVE_STATE` — skip those when looking a definition up by name.

| Key | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NAME` | string | referenced by anims' `PUFFER_STATE` calls |
| `AT_NODE` | `[nodeName, dx?, dy?, dz?]` | attach point; the optional trailing offset is in the host node's own frame, same convention as `LOCAL_VELOCITY` — what spreads C1's three waterfall splash puffers ±11 m either side of the shared anchor `waterfall01` instead of stacking them on one point (fix: the offset was parsed nowhere and silently dropped, in both the compiled-event and reader-event front-ends — 862 of 4387 PUFFER_STATE events in this install carry a non-zero one) |
| `NUMBER` | int | burst mode: sprites spawned per `TIME_INTERVAL` |
| `TIME_INTERVAL` | s | burst/sustained spawn period. Unauthored it is **1.0**, the puffer ctor's own value (`FUN_00550100` writes `0x3f800000` to `+0x40` and to its reciprocal at `+0x44`) and ours. ⚠ In the compiled shape an unauthored key arrives as a **zero** in the garbage interval field, which the applier's setter refuses; a reader `PUFFER_STATE` with no `TIME_INTERVAL` is always a `DISTANCE_INTERVAL` block, where our still-host sputter uses the field instead and keeps its own 0.1 s. The smallest authored value in the install is 0.001 s (`torpufferblast`, the torpedo trail) |
| `DISTANCE_INTERVAL` | m | trail mode: one sprite per N meters of the followed node's motion (`dense_firetrail`: smoke 1.0 m / fire 0.25 m). ⚠ Only accumulated when the frame's motion is **under 200 m** — the teleport guard, see the emission-accumulator section below |
| `LOCAL_VELOCITY` / `WORLD_VELOCITY` | xyz | initial velocity, emitter-local / world frame |
| `MIN_RANDOM_VELOCITY` / `MAX_RANDOM_VELOCITY` | xyz | per-sprite random velocity range |
| `WORLD_ACCELERATION` | xyz | constant acceleration (buoyant smoke rises) |
| `FRICTION` | float | velocity damping |
| `SIZE_RANGE` | [min, max] m | initial sprite size |
| `LIFETIME_RANGE` | [min, max] s | sprite life |
| `GROWTH_FACTOR` | float | size growth over life |
| `DEVIATION_DISTANCE` | m | positional jitter |
| `TEXTURE_SEQUENCE` | [(name, t)…] | **flipbook**: frames keyed by **fraction of the sprite's own lifetime**, 0–1 — *not* seconds (see below) |
| `TEXTURES` | [name…] | **static pool**: each sprite picks one at random (smoke101/102/103) |
| `COLORS` | [[lifeFrac, r, g, b, a]…] | colour-over-age ramp; rgb dual-encoded (the [weather.md](weather.md) rule: any component > 1 ⇒ ÷255), alpha 0–1. `dense_firetrail`'s smoke is born orange (255,164,90) → near-black |
| `FADE_RANGE` (= `FAR_FADE`) | [rampStart, cutoff] m | camera-distance fade: full alpha up to `[0]`, linear to zero at `[1]`, discarded beyond (`fire_n_smoke`: 1500–1700). Two spellings of one block — 574 readers say `FADE_RANGE`, exactly one (C3's `volcanosmoke`) says `FAR_FADE`. **Implemented** (`PufferState.FarFadeStart`/`FarFadeEnd`); the install's widest authored key at 2,508 compiled events over 238 puffers |
| `NEAR_FADE` | [cutoff, fullAlpha] m | near-camera band, compiled name `unk_range`. `[0]` is the **hard discard cutoff** and `[1]` the distance alpha would reach 1 — ⚠ **do not read that order off the values**, five of the six authored pairs are descending (`70,20` almost everywhere). **Implemented** (`PufferState.NearFadeStart`/`NearFadeEnd`). With the shipped data it is a **cull, never a partial alpha** — see the distance-fade section below |
| `START_AGE_RANGE` | [min, max] s | random birth age — a particle is born at `Rand(min, max)` instead of age 0, negative values included (`fire_at_zepskin3`: −1.0 to 0.1). **Implemented** (`PufferState.StartAgeMin`/`StartAgeMax`); authored by only 4 puffers in the install, 80 compiled events total. ⚠ The key is not the whole birth age: the engine's `age0` is this draw **plus** `(1 - frac)·dt`, the sub-frame term of the time-cadence spawn, and it discards the particle outright when `age0 >= life` — so that skip fires on a long frame for **any** puffer, authored key or not |
| `WIND_FACTOR` | float | how strongly the world's wind carries this puffer's particles; **defaults to 1, not 0**, and is inert unless `FRICTION` is non-zero. **Implemented** — see [architecture.md](../architecture.md)'s `Effects/WorldWind.cs` entry |
| `PRIORITY` | float | a per-puffer sprite-size nudge, `1 + K·PRIORITY` with `K = 0.02` (the hardware-path constant — this project has no software path), folded into `BaseSize` at spawn. **Implemented** (`PufferState.Priority`, `Puffer.PriorityScaleDefault`) — 192 compiled events over 47 puffers; default 0, so an unauthored puffer's factor is exactly 1. Almost certainly a depth-priority constant reused for size — this trace found only the size use |

## Emission accumulator

Both continuous modes run one accumulator on the emitter object, and the branch that feeds it is
where they differ: a **distance** emitter adds the frame's motion length, but only when that length
is under 200 m; a **time** emitter adds `dt`. Emission is then the whole
`floor(accumulator / interval)` with the remainder carried. The decoded form, offsets and
addresses are in [`../org/puffer.md`](../org/puffer.md#the-emission-accumulator-fun_0054f8b0)
.

Three things this settles for a reader of the authored keys:

- **The 200 m test is a teleport guard, and it exists only on the distance arm.** Time mode
  accumulates `dt` with no test of any kind. So the guard and a per-frame batch cap are not
  alternatives — they are not even on the same branch.
- **Nothing bounds `count`.** A long frame emits the whole catch-up in that frame; what stops it
  from being visible is not a cap but the spawn's own **born-dead skip** (`age0 >= life` ⇒ no
  particle), which the age offset above makes reachable for any puffer on any long frame.
- **The guard suppresses the frame's emission entirely**, not just the jump's share: the carried
  remainder is by construction below one interval, so `count` is 0 on a guarded frame.

⚠ The emitter's previous position (`+0x78`) is written **unconditionally** at the end of the tick,
guarded frame or not, and a `+0x84` "have I a previous position" flag suppresses the whole emit
block on the emitter's first ever tick. A teleport therefore costs exactly one frame of emission,
and the emitter resumes from the new pose with its remainder intact.

Distance mode is 1,523 of the install's 4,535 compiled `PufferState` events (33.6 %); the crash
debris trails `spurtpuffer1..5` are among them, which is the pooled-and-teleported case the guard
was written for.

## Camera-distance fade

Decoded from the head of `FUN_0054e6e0`, the original's per-particle draw, and implemented in
`Puffer.DistanceAlpha`. The distance `d` is the **view-space DEPTH** along the camera's forward
axis, in metres — not the euclidean range. (`FUN_0054ed10` pre-scales the view matrix's third column
by `_DAT_009fd5d0`, the draw multiplies by `_DAT_009fd5c0`, and on the hardware path `FUN_0053c110`
makes those exact reciprocals; on the software path they do not cancel and the distances come out
scaled, but this project has no software path.) The evaluation, in order:

1. discard if `d·globalFadeFactor >= FADE_RANGE[1]`;
2. if `d·globalFadeFactor <= FADE_RANGE[0]` the **near** band decides: discard if `d <= NEAR_FADE[0]`,
   full alpha if `d >= NEAR_FADE[1]`, else ramp;
3. otherwise ramp across the far band: `alpha = (FADE_RANGE[1] − d·globalFadeFactor) / (FADE_RANGE[1] − FADE_RANGE[0])`;
4. discard if the resulting alpha is `<= 0`.

The alpha **multiplies** whatever the `COLORS` ramp or the life envelope already produced; it
replaces neither.

⚠ **A cross-wire in the original, reproduced deliberately.** The NEAR ramp's origin is
`FADE_RANGE[0]`, not `NEAR_FADE[0]` (`0054e7b5 FSUB [ESI+0x3c]` against the near reciprocal at
`ESI+0x44`, read in raw assembly). It is consistent with `FADE_RANGE` being the original field and
`NEAR_FADE` bolted on later by copy-pasting the far-band line. C3's `volcanosmoke` is the only puffer
in the install whose near pair ascends and therefore the only one that reaches that ramp — where the
wrong origin drives its alpha negative, so it is culled below `NEAR_FADE[1]` and pops in at 75 m.
Every other near pair descends and takes the alpha-1 exit. **The near band is therefore a hard cull
on every puffer in the install**, and "fixing" the cross-wire would invent a 1→75 m fade-in the
original does not have.

⚠ **Almost every explosion effect in `flame_ball.zrd.json` authors `NEAR_FADE [70, 20]`** —
`fierypuffer`, `trailpuffer2`, `fire_n_smoke` and the ball family. Within 70 m of the camera the
original draws none of them, which is a large, visible consequence at any close chase-camera pose;
`puffer.nearCull` exists to switch it off, and defaults on because that is what the original does.

**Three config switches, all defaulting to the original's behaviour** (`puffer.distanceFade` the
authored far ramp, `puffer.farCull` the hard discard past the band, `puffer.nearCull` the near
discard), plus `puffer.globalFadeFactor` — the original's own `PufferSetGlobalFadeFactor`
(`00637a94`, default 1.0), which scales the FAR band only. ⚠ `puffer.farCull:false` alone changes
nothing visible: the authored ramp reaches zero at exactly the cutoff distance, so the two are the
same line. Keeping distant puffers drawn takes `distanceFade:false` and `farCull:false` together.

**`TEXTURE_SEQUENCE` times are lifetime fractions, not seconds.** Across all 1,750 flipbook
`PufferState` events in this install the largest key is **0.8** and none exceeds 1.0 — while
`LIFETIME_RANGE` maxima run from 0.2 s to 5.5 s, so under a seconds reading nobody ever wrote a
sequence longer than 0.8 s for a 5.5 s sprite, 1,750 times running; and the 16 `mag_gunhit`
`firepuffer` events key frames out to 0.5 with a 0.1–0.2 s lifetime, which under that reading
could never draw at all. Read as seconds, `large_30sec_fire`'s `fire_n_smoke` burned
`fire_f01 → fire_f06` in a quarter second and then held the near-black smoke frame for the
other ~95 % of a 3.5–5.5 s life — which is what collapsed the game's most-called death effect
into a stationary red ball instead of a climbing flame.

**Rendering note: no `PUFFER_STATE` key states a blend mode, because blend is not the emitter's to
state.** A sprite draws additively exactly when bit 2 of its texture's render-flags word is set,
which makes the verdict per particle and per flipbook frame rather than per emitter; the decode is
[`../org/textures.md`](../org/textures.md). No texture any puffer in this install names carries the
bit, so every authored emitter alpha-mixes. Neither the `COLORS` ramp nor the sprite's own
brightness enters into it.

## Aircraft speed-cue wisps

Each chapter's `speed_cue.zrd` authors the pale puffs that appear ahead of the player's aircraft.
Although the animation and its three puffer sequences are `ON_CALL`, player setup starts
`speed_cue`; its controller then loops every 0.1 s. This is why a census that excludes `ON_CALL`
puffers incorrectly misses an ambient effect.

The controller disables the effect within 50 m of the ground. By camera altitude it selects a
30 m interval / 18 m deviation puffer below 800 m, 15 m / 25 m from 800–900 m, 8 m / 30 m from
900–1200 m, and 15 m / 25 m from 1200–1500 m. Each emitter is attached to `player` at local
`(0,0,-60)`, 60 m ahead of the aircraft. All use zero base velocity, ±0.8 m/s random velocity,
2.5–4.5 m initial size, 3–4 s lifetime, growth 1.25, and random static
`smoke101`/`smoke102`/`smoke103` textures. Their colour ramp is transparent white → low-alpha
white at half-life → transparent black. C1 uses peak alpha 0.4/0.5/0.5; C4 uses 0.6/0.7/0.7.

The generic distance-puffer update leaves emitted particles in world space. Consequently the
aircraft passes through each puff, and its screen-visible duration falls approximately inversely
with airspeed. This effect is separate from both chapter cloud-card populations and the
hard-coded throttle-rise exhaust below. CSVM implements it in `Flight.SpeedCue`, loading the
chapter reader verbatim and assigning one private renderer set to each player rig.

## Aircraft throttle-rise exhaust

`crimson.exe` also constructs one puffer outside the authored `PUFFER_STATE` readers. Aircraft
initialization (`FUN_00476250`) resolves `exhaust%d` model nodes (`exhaust1`, `exhaust2`, …)
and calls `FUN_004af9e0` → `FUN_004afa20` once per node. The latter allocates a generic puffer
through `FUN_00550100` and attaches it at zero local offset.

It is a distance trail: one particle per **0.4 m**, random velocity **−0.1..+0.1 m/s** on each
axis, initial size **0.2..0.3 m**, lifetime **0.5..1.5 s**, friction **1.2**, deviation **0.001 m**,
and normalized scale **1.0 → 3.45** over life. Each particle chooses `smoke101`, `smoke102` or
`smoke103`; the colour ramp is near-black at age 0.2 and transparent black at age 1, with a
**200..300 m** distance fade. `FUN_004afbc0` activates it from a positive
commanded-versus-current throttle gap and otherwise decays it to off. The generic puffer update
`FUN_0054ee10` → `FUN_0054f8b0` samples each exhaust node's world transform and leaves emitted
particles in world space, which is why they pass behind the moving aircraft.

This is the executable counterpart of the throttle-rise smoke described in
`CSVM/src/Flight/ThrottleSlamSmoke.cs`, not the speed-cue wisp system. The full Ghidra trace of
both emitters, and of the mechanisms ruled out on the way to them, is in
`analysis/bl-317-plane-wisps/FINDINGS.md`.


## Texture flipbooks

The install animates textures through **three** distinct mechanisms. They are easy to confuse
because they share the same frame sets (`fire101-112` etc.), so:

1. **Puffer flipbooks** - `PUFFER_STATE`'s `TEXTURES`/`TEXTURE_SEQUENCE`, played per *particle*.
   Implemented (`src/Effects/Puffer.cs`); this is what animates crash fireballs and damage trails.
2. **Material cycles** - a gamez material's own `cycle` block: `texture_indices` (the frame
   list), `speed` (fps), `looping`. Played on the *surface*.`r`n (`src/Mech3/TextureCycler.cs`).
   Only 1-7 materials per chapter carry one, but they cover the animated sea: C1B has `wtr00000` x16
   @10 fps over 695 polygons and `srf0001` x16 @9 over 375, plus `wakefront1` x5 @12 (boat wakes)
   and `turb01` x6 @12 (turbulence); C1 has `splash01` x3 @4 and the `bmanwalk`/`bmanrun` x6 @9
   crowd sprites. `ObjectCycleTexture{name, reset}` (144 events, carrying no frame list of its own)
   is the anim-side trigger for these - still unimplemented, so cycles currently run free rather than being started/reset by animation.
3. **The `EFFECTS` reader** - `extracted/zrdr/effects.zrd.json`, the same idea reached through a
   proxy NODE:

   ```
   ["fire1.flt", "NAME", ["fire1"], "SPEED", [10.0], "LOOPING", ["ON"],
    "MAPS", ["fire101.tif", ..., "fire112.tif"]]
   ["fire2.flt", "NAME", ["fire2"], "SPEED", [5.0],  "LOOPING", ["ON"],
    "MAPS", ["fire101.tif", ..., "fire106.tif"]]
   ```

   Exactly two entries exist, and no compiled anim definition anywhere has a non-null `effects`
   array, so this reader is the only source. `fire1`/`fire2` are single `Facade`/`CylindricalY`
   quads (`fire101.tif`/`fire102.tif`) under **parentless template nodes** loaded from
   `common\effects\models\` by `support\load.gw`.

   **The entry names a node, but what it animates is that node's MATERIAL** (decoded out of
   `crimson.exe`, see [`anim-definitions.md`](anim-definitions.md#fire-animations)).
   The engine resolves the node, walks to the first mesh under it, and installs the frame list on
   surface 0's material record, which is the same per-material cycle block as (2); the draw loop
   then tests the material's own cycled bit per polygon. Materials are one record per texture, so
   `fire1.flt` is a **proxy** exactly like the interp's `watersetup`/`surfsetup`, and the cycle
   reaches every polygon on that material. `src/Mech3/EffectCycles.cs` implements this,
   which applies both entries to their gamez materials before the world build so the existing
   `TextureCycler` picks them up. It needs no `OBJECT_ADD_CHILD` and no burn site.

**C1's refinery gas flare IS a flipbook.** `flame01` shares material 88 (`fire101.tif`) with the
`fire1` template, so the EFFECTS cycle installed on that material animates it: 12 frames at 10 fps,
looping, from load, with no trigger. `mb1` and `mb_spinflame` are on the same material and flip in
lockstep with it. Its `LIGHT_STATE` flicker is real and separate - `refinery_fire.zrd.json` cycles
`orange_light`'s range 2->11, 3->15, 1.5->10, 2.5->14 in a tight loop - so the flare both animates
its texture and pulses its spill. ⚠ This entry claimed `flame01` was a static billboard
whose apparent motion was only the light; that was wrong, and the muzzle-flash observation behind it
did not survive the draw-loop decode.

## Evidence & limits

This page states current format facts. Claim-specific evidence and limits remain beside the claims they support.

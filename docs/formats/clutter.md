# Clutter: `interp.json` boot scripts & clutter templates

Part of the [format documentation](README.md). Covers how the original populates
forests/bushes (and city blocks) without a single placed tree node in the gamez.
Consumed by `CSVM/src/Mech3/Clutter.cs`.

**The decorations' own authored properties — substitution tables, scale ranges, fade distances —
are a separate file**, `templates.zrd`, keyed by decoration model rather than by template. See
[templates.md](templates.md).

**A second, independent clutter system uses the same template roots**: `fogvol.zrd` scatters
`cloudsprite1`/`cloudsprite2` through the world's `fvol*` fog volumes, with its own reader-side
weights and ranges rather than `AddClutterTemplates`. Template-root lookup is shared
(`ClutterBuilder.FindTemplateRoot`); everything else is separate — see [fogvol.md](fogvol.md).

## `interp.json` — the engine boot scripts

`interp.zbd` (extracted by `unzbd cs interp`) is a JSON array of scripts
`{ "name": "support\\<chapter>\\adjust.gw", "lines": [ … ] }` — the engine's boot/setup
command lists. The chapter's `adjust.gw` script registers clutter templates via lines of
the form:

```
AddClutterTemplates terpat02 river1 river2
```

(one or more template names per line; C1 registers `terpat02`, `river1`, `river2`).
The same script loads the templates into the gamez as **parentless, unreferenced
subtrees** — which is why a placed-node walk of the world never sees them, and why
template roots must be looked up among parentless Object3d nodes by name (the world also
contains unrelated same-named leaf nodes).

## Template subtree shape

```
templateRoot (parentless Object3d, e.g. terpat02)
└─ ground node — first descendant with a mesh: a flat quad whose
   │             • texture names the terrain texture it decorates
   │             •   (terpat02.tif = C1's forest texture)
   │             • UV parameterisation is the DOMAIN each decoration's
   │             •   position is normalised against — never a metric
   │             •   spacing (see "no world grid" below)
   └─ decoration nodes — one local transform each (position within the patch),
      └─ decoration mesh, exactly one level below: either a single vertical
         one-sided quad (tree/bush billboard, e.g. firtree1.tif) or a 3D
         building/vehicle mesh (e.g. cb02a.flt, resbuild11.flt, c_studebaker2.flt)
```

**The chain is always exactly two nodes deep, and only the decoration node carries a
transform.** Across every decoration of every template in C2 and C5:
`deco → mesh` in 249 of 249 cases, and 0 of them put a non-identity transform on the mesh
node. So one node's local transform is the whole placement.

**Authored orientation is identity — the variety is in the model list, not in rotation.**
Same survey: every 3D decoration's local basis is identity to within **0.108°**, and the
one node stored as a matrix rather than Euler angles is a 0.03° rotation. A city block
varies because the template names 17–28 *different* building models, not because it turns
them. (The remake keeps the authored basis anyway — it is the correct thing to consume,
and it costs nothing — but be aware that a screenshot cannot tell a correct implementation
from one that dropped the basis on this data.)

Decoration Y offsets are likewise near-zero: template ground quads sit at exactly `y = 0`
and building bases sit at `−0.02 … +3.67` relative to it.

The engine dresses **every world polygon textured with a template's ground texture** with that
template's decorations. The decorations are single one-sided cards, so the original must render
them as upright (Y-axis) billboards.

## ✅ Decoded 2026-08-09/10: the placement is a UV lattice, and there is no world grid

This section previously said the original's alignment of the pattern to the terrain was
**undecoded**, and that UV-space placement was ruled out because "the world's UV tiling is wildly
non-uniform on hillsides, so it would visibly stretch the clutter". Both claims are dead.
Stretching with the UV is precisely what the original does.

`FUN_004dd230` stores each decoration's position as its **interpolated texture UV on the ground
quad**, wrapped into [0,1) — which is why the quad is a domain and not a distance. `FUN_004dd6e0`
then stamps it **once per integer UV cell of each world triangle**: take the triangle's UV bounding
box, floor it to an integer lattice, test containment *in UV space*, and recover the world XYZ
through the triangle's own affine UV→world map. The clutter therefore rotates, mirrors and
stretches with the painted ground texture, and a building sits in its painted block wherever that
block lands.

There is **no world-space grid and no global clutter origin** in the original at all. The remake's
fixed X/Z grid was a fiction with no counterpart, and it cost C1 roughly 4× its trees — its terrain
is painted with `terpat02` at half the template quad's scale, so one repeat spans ~260 m where the
grid stepped 512. The measurements are in
`analysis/bl-305-clutter-uv/FINDINGS-A1.md` / `-A2.md` and `docs/PLAN-clutter-uv-placement.md`.

**Which polygons get dressed is a per-polygon decision**, made by the `no_clutter` flag (raw
polygon bit `0x800`, `FUN_004de2c0`). It does not mean "leave this ground bare": where two coplanar
layers are painted over each other it selects which one decorates. See `docs/architecture.md`'s
`src/Mech3/Clutter.cs` entry and [gamez.md](gamez.md).

**Sprite vs non-sprite is in the data, not the shape.** A decoration is a billboard card
iff its model carries `model_type: "Facade"` — the original engine's own billboard flag
(see [gamez.md](gamez.md) and the `FacadeMode` axis values). Every tree/bush/palm
decoration in the install is `Facade` + `CylindricalY`, one polygon, four vertices, flat
in local Z; every 3D building decoration is `model_type: "Default"` with 2–27 polygons.
**Do not classify on `facade_mode` alone** — the 3D building decorations carry a *stale*
`CylindricalY` in that field while being `Default`, so the type is the discriminator.

## Non-sprite decorations: the city blocks

C2's `filmblock*` / `resblock*` / `parklot*` and C5's `cblock*` templates carry **3D
building meshes** as decorations, not sprite quads. They are placed by exactly the same
rule as the sprites — the same UV lattice, the same containment test, the same affine recovery of
the world position — and differ only in what is drawn and whether it is solid (a 3D decoration also
keeps its authored basis and Y, which a sprite drops). The remake uses this model (polish-3
item 6); before that they were skipped, which is why C2 and C5 rendered painted city-block
ground with nothing standing on it.

Counts are the remake's; a grid approach produced
10,261/37,167 and 71,326/124,072 respectively.

| chapter | templates | 3D decorations placed | sprites placed |
|---|---|---|---|
| C2 | `filmblock1-5`, `resblock1-6`, `parklot1-2` | 10,346 | 36,406 |
| C5 | `cblock1-7`, all registered and all placed (see below) | 67,836 | 110,668 |

`parkpat` (C2) and every other chapter's templates are sprite-only, so no other
chapter gains or loses anything. **C2B's `adjust.gw` registers six templates — `terpat01`,
`terpat03`, `terpat04`, `resblock2`, `filmblock1`, `filmblock2` — and its gamez ships not one of
those roots** (the original logs `ClutterLoadTemplates(): cannot find node for template %s` six
times). The boot script and the gamez disagree, C2B has always placed no clutter at all, and its
`templates.zrd` is consistently empty. That is retail data, not a bug in the reader.

**A block's variety comes from its model list.** `cblock1` names 28 3D decorations drawn
from 11 distinct models; each is stamped once per integer UV repeat of `cblock1.tif` across
every triangle painted with it.

**C5's `cblock4/5/6` are placed like every other district**, and the map-wide
`BuriedClutterDistricts` does not remove them. It
because the remake stamped both members of every coplanar overlay/base pair — matching a template
to a polygon by texture name only, never reading the polygon's flag — which doubled the city's
buildings (`analysis/bl-058-clutter-doubling/FINDINGS.md`). The real mechanism is the `no_clutter`
flag: flagged ground is dressed by `cblock4/5/6` (low-rise) and clear ground by `cblock1/2/3/7`
(towers), measured at odds ratio 1,037× and confirmed at the controls
(`analysis/bl-305-clutter-uv/FINDINGS-layer-pairing.md`). ⚠ Neither half works alone — the flag
gate *with* the exemption still in force empties C5's downtown, because the ground there IS the
flagged layer and its replacement was the exempted one. ⚠ The building sets are **not** disjoint by
name range: `cblock5/6`
also place `cb06a`/`cb11a`, and the *visible* `cblock7` places `cb12a`/`13a`/`14a` — census by
template root, never by `cbNNa` name range.

**`cbNNa` and `cbNNdet01` are co-located halves of one building, not a LOD pair.** Every
`det` decoration in `cblock1` sits at the *exact* same local origin as its `a` sibling, but
with a different footprint and a different texture family (`roof01`/`bldg*` for `a`,
`genbldg3`/`nosegun5` for `det`). Both are drawn. The `det` meshes are 40% of a block's
collision triangles, so an implementation looking to cut collision cost will be tempted to
drop them — note first that they are geometry, not decoration, and that "det" is a name
heuristic with nothing in the data behind it.

## Sprites are not collidable; 3D decorations are



> Trees are collidable in the original (`spruce_destroy` anims exist; destruction is
> weapons-era behavior).

**That was a misreading of the data.** The only two `spruce_destroy` strings in the whole
install are `..\data\common\zrdr\planes\spruce_destroy1.zrd` (C2/M01) and
`..\data\common\zrdr\planes\spruce_destroy2.zrd` (C5/M03) — in the **`planes\`** directory.
Reading the files settles it: they define `g_engine*` animations with `prop_part`, `spin` /
`counterspin`, `snd_propstart` and engine puffers. This is the **Spruce Goose**, Howard
Hughes' flying boat and the C2/M01 mission object, whose folder siblings are
`sprucegoose-fly_the_goose`, `free_the_goose`, `goose_cooked` and `spruce_enginedest`.

**There is no spruce-*tree* animation, and no tree-destruction animation of any kind,
anywhere in the install.** The remake therefore gives clutter **sprites** no collider at
all  — consistent with every other billboard, which is a flat
card whose collider would be a phantom wall wherever the card happens to be facing.

**The 3D decorations are the opposite case and DO collide** :
they are real multi-polygon geometry with real sides, they do not turn, and flying through
a skyscraper is not something the original permits.

**How they collide: one shared shape per model, attached per placement** (reworked
The first implementation transformed every
vertex of every placement into world space and merged the result into one trimesh per
1024 m region — 2,554,455 collision triangles in C5 and 202,303 in C2, built from about
2,300 and 1,400 distinct ones respectively. It was written that way to avoid ~80k
collision bodies, which is a real problem, but body count and shape count are not the same
thing: a `Shape3D` is shareable and can be attached to a body with its own transform and no
scene-tree node of its own. The remake now builds one shape per distinct decoration mesh
and attaches it once per placement, keeping the per-region body split only for broadphase
locality and for a locating name in the crash log.

That distinction matters to any reimplementation because **the cost was never in the
vertex arithmetic**. In C5: 3,796 ms to build the merged version, of
which only 271 ms was transforming those 2.55M vertices and **3,403 ms was building the
concave shapes' BVHs**. Sharing the shapes removed essentially all of it — the BVHs being
built are ~40 triangles each — and C5's `--fly` load fell from ~7,100 ms to ~3,550 ms.

Note that the geometry is unchanged: the same triangles, still concave, still
`BackfaceCollision`. Approximating a block with a convex hull or a box was considered and
rejected on the data, not on cost — `cbNNdet01` decorations enclose almost no volume
(measured fill fractions 0.003–0.05 of their bounding box) because they are open detail
shells, so a hull or box of one would be a phantom solid up to 62 m tall where the data
intends a facade.

The map-edge continuation carries the border tiles' clutter along, sprites and buildings
alike. Sprites stay pass-through there as everywhere; **the buildings are solid** since
2026-07-22 — attaching an existing shared shape at each mirrored placement costs one call
per building (measured: 0.5–0.6 ms for the ~3,900 buildings of a boundary-crossing
rebuild, inside a rebuild that already cost ~4.1 ms), where rebuilding a merged region
trimesh on that frame would have been a visible hitch. See
[world-structure.md](world-structure.md).

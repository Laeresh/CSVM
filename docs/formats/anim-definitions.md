# ANIMATION_DEFINITION readers (zepstate, startanims, building/vehicle anims)

Part of the [format documentation](README.md). Validated against this install's zrdr
extraction (mech3ax v0.6.1), 2026-07-18, while implementing the anim-state engine part 1
(mission start states). Field tables + tiny excerpt values only — no bulk game data.

The original compiles these reader sources into per-mission `mis_anim.zbd` archives
(a binary format upstream mech3ax does not support; the project's mech3ax **fork decodes
it** — see the compiled-archives section below); the zrdr JSON sources carry the same
definitions, so scanning them is a full substitute for state purposes.

## At a glance

This family documents reader and compiled animation definitions for world state, motion, lights, sound, and template calls.

## Where definitions live

Three zrdr scopes are visible to a mission (the remake scans all reader files in each
whose content mentions `ANIMATION_DEFINITIONS`):

| Scope | Examples |
|---|---|
| shared `zrdr.zbd` | `small_building`, `medium_building`, `aa_gun`, `wing_light`, `plane_props`, zeppelin part anims (`multi1_*`, `pzep_*`, …) |
| chapter `<Cx>/zrdr.zbd` | C1: `hangar3`, `train`, `fuel_tanks`, `ref_fueltanks`, `train_signal`, `ap_*` airfield buildings |
| mission `<Cx>/<mission>/zrdr.zbd` | `zepstate` (per-mission base object states), `mis_anim` (mostly `ANIMATION_DEFINITION_FILE` references), mission one-offs (`hangar_panic` in C1/M02) |

A mission's `mis_anim.json` lists `ANIMATION_DEFINITION_FILE` paths into the *source*
data tree (`..\data\common\zrdr\zeps\*.zrd`); those files are the shared-scope readers
under their extracted names — following the references is unnecessary when scanning all
three scopes.

## File shape

```
[["ANIMATION_DEFINITIONS", [
    ("GRAVITY", [-9.8])?  ("ANIMATION_PATH", ["..\\data\\…"])?
    "ANIMATION_LIST", [
        "ANIMATION_DEFINITION", [ …def… ],     ; repeated
        "ANIMATION_DEFINITION_FILE", ["path"], ; mis_anim only
        … ] ] ]]
```

Alternating key/value-list pairs **with meaningful duplicate keys** (multiple
`SEQUENCE_DEFINITION`s per def, repeated op kinds per sequence) — a collapsing dict
view loses data; walk the raw list. A key followed by `null` (or by another key) is a
bare flag (`LOCAL_NODES_ONLY`).

## ANIMATION_DEFINITION fields

| Key | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NAME` | 1 string | The world/object node(s) this def anchors to. Wildcards make one anim instance per matching node: `*`/`**` = any run of characters (`ftank0*`, `s_build**`), `#` = run of digits (`air_gen#`). Node names may be given without their `.flt` model suffix (`ap_radiotwr` ↔ gamez node `ap_radiotwr.flt`). |
| `NAME1` | list of (wildcard, [path…]) pairs | Multi-target form (zeppelin nacelle/turret sets): maps anim-instance name patterns to node paths inside a parent object. Per-object anims — part 2 scope. |
| `ANIMATION_NAME` | 1 string | The name `startanims.json` / `CALL_ANIMATION` refer to. May itself carry a wildcard in template defs (`ftank_boom*`). |
| `ANIMATION_ROOT_NAME` | 1 string | The node inside each instance the anim attaches to (`s_bld_healthy`, bare `healthy`). Needed to locate instances whose roots have free names: `m_build**` instances in C1 are `apbuild01.flt`/`aphngr01.flt`/…, found via their `m_bld_healthy` child. |
| `LOCAL_NODES_ONLY` | bare flag | Op node names resolve inside the instance subtree only (building/vehicle templates). |
| `ACTIVATION` | `ON_STARTUP` \| `ON_CALL` | ON_STARTUP defs run their sequences at mission load (`zepstate`); ON_CALL waits for `CALL_ANIMATION`/game events. Sequences may carry their own `ACTIVATION ON_CALL` (run only via `CALL_SEQUENCE`). |
| `EXECUTION_BY_RANGE` | 1 float, **metres** | Proximity gate: the def executes only with a player within this distance of its anchor. Compiled as `execution: {ByRange: {min, max}}` in **metres SQUARED** (reader 50 ↔ compiled 2500) — the same reader↔compiled unit divergence as `PLAYER_RANGE`; `min` is 0 across the install. On an ON_STARTUP def the runtime defers the start until a player first enters the band (the C3 `spiderweb_gone` 50 m fade; the 300 m nacelle-prop spins; C1's reader-only `cloudparent#` at 1900 m). 883 compiled defs carry it. |
| `RESET_TIME` | 1–2 floats (−1 common) | Reset scheduling (undecoded detail). |
| `RESET_STATE` | op list | The object's **base state**, applied at load: healthy variants ACTIVE, `destroyed` variants INACTIVE, doors at rest pose. This is what fixes the destroyed-over-healthy coplanar flicker. |
| `SEQUENCE_DEFINITION` | op list (repeatable) | One timeline of ops; optional `NAME`, optional `ACTIVATION`. |
| `HEALTH`, `DAMAGE_SEQUENCE` | | Destructible-object HP + damage-threshold script (`IF ANIM_HEALTH n … CALL_ANIMATION sputter_fire_smoke_obj …`). |
| `SAVE_LOG` | `ON` \| `OFF` | The def's state goes into the engine's **state log** — the record that survives a mission reload and a save/restore. See "`SAVE_LOG` / `PERSIST_LOG` are the cross-mission state log". |
| `PERSIST_LOG` | `ON` | The def's state **additionally crosses mission boundaries**: a later mission in the same chapter loads with it applied. A strict subset of `SAVE_LOG ON` (62 defs, all of them fixed world scenery). Same section. |
| `EXECUTION_PRIORITY`, `AUTO_RESET_NODE_STATES`, `AUTO_ADD_TO_WORLD` | | Engine bookkeeping, undecoded detail. |

## State ops (the part-1 subset)

| Op | Body | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE` | `NAME` [node…], `STATE` [`ACTIVE`\|`INACTIVE`] | Show/hide a subtree (and its collidability). A multi-entry NAME is a parent→child path (`["piratezep","interior"]`). |
| `OBJECT_TRANSLATE_STATE` | `NAME`, `STATE` [x,y,z], `RELATIVE` | **Absolute** position in the node's parent frame (see below). `RELATIVE` is `false` in all 1143 uses in this install. |
| `OBJECT_ROTATE_STATE` | `NAME`, `STATE` [x,y,z], `BASIS` | **Absolute** orientation in the parent frame — **radians compiled, degrees in the zrdr sources** (see "rotations" below). `BASIS` is `"Absolute"` in 6430 of ~6600 uses; the rest are `AtNodeXYZ`/`AtNodeMatrix` look-at forms (zeppelins, cameras). |
| `OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO` | `NAME`, `TRANSLATE`/`ROTATE`/`SCALE` `{from,to}`, `RUN_TIME` [s] | Timed motion between two **absolute** parent-frame poses (C1 hangar 3: four `h3_dr*` doors over 9–10 s). The rotate channel shares `OBJECT_ROTATE_STATE`'s unit split. |
| `OBJECT_MOTION` | `NAME`, `XYZ_ROTATION` [ix,iy,iz,dx,dy,dz], optional `RUN_TIME` [s] — plus the `GRAVITY`/`TRANSLATION[_RANGE]`/`FORWARD_ROTATION`/`SCALE`/`BOUNCE_SEQUENCE` channels | Two ops in one: a **steady spin** (`XYZ_ROTATION` alone, at `initial` rad/s — deg/s in the reader — endless without `RUN_TIME`; the zeppelin nacelle props) OR a **ballistic body** (translate/launch + scale ramp + tumble under gravity; the crash pieces and debris arcs). See "`OBJECT_MOTION` is two ops sharing one event". |

### `OBJECT_OPACITY_STATE` is translucency, not visibility

`state` is whether translucency is **enabled**; `opacity` is the alpha while it is. The data
settles this: across all 168 compiled uses, `state=false` pairs with `opacity=1.0` **136 times
and with 0.0 never**, so `false` means "render normally", not "disappear". Hiding is
`OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE`'s job and the data uses both side by side. The three shapes shipped are
`(false, 1.0)` ×136, `(true, 1.0)` ×16 and `(true, 0.4)` ×16.

**The reader writes the token and the value in EITHER ORDER, and the value is optional.** All
five spellings occur: `["ON", 0.6]`, `[0.4, "ON"]`, `["OFF", 1]`, `[1, "OFF"]` and a bare
`["OFF"]` (value defaults to 1). So a normalizer must scan the list by type, not by position.

`OBJECT_OPACITY_FROM_TO` tweens the same pair with a `RUN_TIME`; a fade-out is
`(true,1.0) → (false,0.0)` ×5073 and a fade-in `(true,0.0) → (false,1.0)` ×4609, i.e. the end
state disables translucency once the object is fully opaque again (or is deactivated outright).
**Implemented 2026-07-23** (`AnimRuntime.OpacityFade`, the biggest un-handled kind at 9,917
events): a linear lerp of the two `opacity` numbers over `RUN_TIME`, driven through the same
per-instance `csky_opacity` parameter `OBJECT_OPACITY_STATE` writes. ⚠ **The endpoint `state`
flag does NOT invert the value** — surveyed across all 9,917, `(state=false, opacity=0)` fades to
invisible and `(state=false, opacity=1)` to opaque — so it is a literal lerp of the opacity, not
the "false → render normally (1.0)" rule `OBJECT_OPACITY_STATE` uses. `opacity_delta` is null in
100% of them, so nothing here says what it would have meant (unlike
`OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO`'s `*_delta`, which ships values and is decoded below). Opacity is a
separate channel from the transform, so a fade coexists with a live motion on the same node (the
crash `dust` scales and fades at once). **Only ONE of the 9,917 is ever reached at bootstrap** —
C3's `spiderweb_gone` (`ON_STARTUP`, fades `spiderweb` 1→0 over 0.7 s so the web is gone by
default); the rest are `ON_CALL`/`WEAPON_HIT`, fired by a crash or (in M3) a kill.

**What is reachable:** 683 dispatches across C1/C3/C4/C5, **zero unresolvable**. C1's
`cloudparent#` — `ON_STARTUP`, `EXECUTION_BY_RANGE 1900`, a `LOOP{-1}` re-asserting every frame
— sets the cloud sprites to **0.6**, and is the single largest use in the game; C5 sets `wl_glw`
and `cfglow` to 0.4; C3/C4 drive the barrage balloons (`bont*`/`balloon_t*`/`tether*`) and
`bhf_support*`, all at `state=false` (i.e. normal).

⚠ **Observing the C1 clouds needs two things switched off**, which is why a first pass wrongly
concluded the event had no visible effect: the opaque `cloudlayer` **`CloudDeck` occludes them
from below**, and at any normal viewing distance **fog washes them to exactly `FOG_COLOR`**. With
the deck hidden and fog off (static `--viewer --chapter=C1`, no `--sky-zone`) the effect is
obvious — 74,129 px change, the clouds going from hard opaque white to translucent.

### `FogState` — decoded, deliberately not acted on

The compiled archives carry a `FogState` event kind: mid-mission weather change is a real engine
capability. **The data uses it exactly once install-wide** —
`extracted/C1/M04/mis_anim/camera1-mission_intro_animation.json`, `reset_state/events[4]`
(surveyed across all 12,746 `mis_anim` + 3,368 `cam_anim` files, 2026-07-22):

```json
{"FogState": {"name": "drop_fog", "type_": null,
              "color": {"r": 0.69, "g": 0.69, "b": 0.69},
              "altitude": {"min": 10000.0, "max": 11000.0},
              "range": {"min": 1000.0, "max": 1500.0}}}
```

Note what it is *not*: it carries its fog parameters **inline** and matches neither of C1's
weather.json zones (zone1 1000–1750 alt 970–1047, zone2 1000–4000 alt 4000–5000). So it is an
ad-hoc third fog state applied to a cutscene camera, **not a zone selector** — it does not answer
"which zone does a mission fly", which remains engine-side (see
[weather.md](weather.md#which-zone-a-mission-flies-is-not-in-any-file-searched-exhaustively-2026-07-22)).
`AnimRuntime` therefore does not implement it: one occurrence, on the one cutscene camera the
remake does not run, and implementing it would mean a second write path onto the `csky_fog_*`
globals that `Session.WeatherRig.Build` owns. If the user ever observes fog visibly changing
*during* a mission somewhere else, that is evidence for the engine-side zone switch and this
should be revisited.

### `OBJECT_MOTION` is two ops sharing one event

`OBJECT_MOTION` is the original's rigid-body descriptor, and its 7,442 uses split cleanly into
two jobs that have nothing to do with each other. Surveyed across all 8 chapters, 2026-07-22:

| Shape | Count | What it is |
|---|---:|---|
| `XYZ_ROTATION` only (± `RUN_TIME`) | 3,521 | A **steady spin** about the node's own axes. |
| `+ GRAVITY`/`TRANSLATION[_RANGE]`/`FORWARD_ROTATION`/`BOUNCE_SEQUENCE` | 3,807 | **Ballistic debris** thrown by a kill. |
| `SCALE` only | 114 | A scale ramp (`ballflare`, the explosion flare, 65→75 over 1.75 s). |

**The split is exactly the reachability boundary.** All 590 `ON_STARTUP` uses are
rotation-only; every ballistic use is `ON_CALL`/`WEAPON_HIT`, fired by a crash or (in M3) a kill.
So the rotation half runs through the lightweight `AnimRuntime.SpinMotion` (unchanged — the
ambient world boots byte-for-byte the same), and the ballistic/scale/tumble half is **implemented
2026-07-23** through `AnimRuntime.MotionRuntime`, a full rigid body in the node's parent frame,
seeded from its **authored rest** pose for a launch and from its live pose otherwise (2026-08-01: a
shared effect template's children are never re-homed between calls, so seeding a launch from the
live pose walked every repeat explosion's debris further from the blast than the one before):

- `TRANSLATION.initial` is the launch **velocity** (a crash piece leaves at y=10 m/s); `rnd_xz` a
  per-axis random spread added to it (through the runtime's **seedable** `_rng`, so a lab replay
  is deterministic); `delta` a constant **acceleration** along the launch, in m/s² — **not** a ramp
  divided by `RUN_TIME`, which is how it was read until 2026-08-11 (non-zero on 92 of the 757
  vector-form events).
- `TRANSLATION_RANGE` is a ballistic launch in **polar form** — **`xz` is an AZIMUTH and `y` an
  ELEVATION, both in DEGREES, and `initial` is the launch SPEED in m/s** (`delta` the same constant
  acceleration, non-zero on 233 of 1,226). **Decoded 2026-08-01**, replacing a distance reading that
  threw debris hundreds of metres; census + evidence in `analysis/object-motion-range/`.
  ⚠ **The elevation is LINEAR, not spherical**, and that was corrected on 2026-08-13: the direction
  is `dirY = elevation/90` with the horizontal taking the remainder `1 − |elevation|/90`, so it is
  deliberately **not unit length** (0.707 at 45°) and only the azimuth goes through trigonometry. Do
  not normalise it — the unit-sphere reading launches 60–70° debris 20–25 % too fast. The mechanism
  is in [`../org/objectMotion.md`](../org/objectMotion.md). Over all 1,217 events install-wide
  every `xz` lies in [−170, 359] and every `y` but one in [−90, 90]; `y` goes negative exactly where
  the thing falls (a balloon turret's parts at −70…−90 against a collapsing dock platform's +70…+80);
  the five `fly_trailN` of one explosion carry evenly spaced azimuth bands (35–55, 85–105, 135–165,
  185–205, 235–255) — the starburst the original's HE impact shows; and `gunshell` reads ±10° of
  bearing at −75…−85° elevation and 1.5–1.8 m/s, i.e. brass dropping out of the gun port.
  `TRANSLATION_RANGE_MIN_ONLY` (112 events) marks rows whose `max` fields are all 0 and meaningless
  — there the min IS the value. ⚠ 623 of 3,651 ranges have `min > max`, so interpolate rather than
  clamp. ⚠ Which world bearing azimuth 0 points along (+X in the engine) is a choice, not a decode:
  the data fixes the trails' spacing relative to each other, never their absolute compass.
- `GRAVITY.value` (negative) accelerates the launch, and is an **absolute m/s², not an offset to the
  aircraft's arcade `nom_gravity` of 20** — the census carries a literal −9.8 on 173 events (and −10
  on 400); the weak −1/−2/−3 values sit on smoke trails, where floating is the authored look.
  ⚠ **A ground-contact test is the DEFAULT, and `DO_INTERSECTIONS` only upgrades it** — from a
  vertical column under the body to a full geometry sweep, which is what lands a piece on a rooftop
  or stops it against a wall. `NO_ALTITUDE` is the opt-out and `gunshell` alone authors it. This was
  read the other way round — the test gated on `DO_INTERSECTIONS`, `NO_ALTITUDE` as something about
  spawn altitude — until 2026-08-13; the corrected mechanism is in
  [`../org/objectMotion.md`](../org/objectMotion.md). Every gravity-bearing body therefore lands,
  including the free-falling shapes (zeppelin gasbags, lifeboats, `chuteman` descents) that had been
  deferred as `BL-245` on the older reading.
  A third launch shape is worth knowing: **neither `RUN_TIME` nor `BOUNCE_SEQUENCE`**, where the
  event's duration is what the sequence's NEXT (null-start) event waits on — in 159 of 167 cases
  install-wide, the flying piece's own `ACTIVE_STATE 0`. Censused 2026-08-06 (`BL-257`,
  `analysis/bl-257-nulled-launch/`): a body with no `RUN_TIME` reports the parabola's return to
  launch height as its duration, so these are hidden when they land rather than on the launch tick.
  `dblcannon_flying_parts` is the reachable case — eight parts at elevation 10–70°, 17–25 m/s, each
  switched off by its own following event. ⚠ 8 of the 167 have no apex and report no duration; the
  vertical speed is `(elevation/90)·speed`, so **a negative speed range inverts an upward elevation**
  (`fuelboxbreaks`' rockerarm, elevation 90° at speed −45…45).
- `FORWARD_ROTATION.Time.initial` is a tumble **RATE in rad/s** and `delta` its acceleration, so
  `RUN_TIME` never enters the derivation. The compiled numbers fly as they are — the reader's
  authored `initial` is converted deg→rad at parse and `delta` stored raw. **The axis is decoded,
  not chosen**: the body turns about the horizontal perpendicular of its own `TRANSLATION_RANGE`
  launch direction, unnormalised, so its length is that launch's `1 − |elevation|/90` and a steep
  throw turns slowly off the same number.
  ⚠ A `TRANSLATION` (vector) launch never fills that direction, so those bodies **do not tumble at
  all** — 495 of the install's 1,399 tumbles, the `player_crash_dirt` pieces among them. ⚠
  `FORWARD_ROTATION DISTANCE` (the same shape driven by the step rather than by time) is authored
  **nowhere** in this install: all 1,399 author `Time`. Mechanism and addresses in
  [`../org/objectMotion.md`](../org/objectMotion.md).
- `SCALE.initial`/`delta` a linear scale ramp that is an **OFFSET from unit scale, not an absolute
  size**: `scale = 1 + initial + delta·u`. Unlike `OBJECT_SCALE_STATE`/`OBJECT_SCALE_FROM_TO`, which
  are absolute. **Settled 2026-08-01** by the install's commonest value — a bare `(-0.1, -0.1, -0.1)`
  with zero delta on **30 of the 45 distinct SCALE events** (every `h2twr`/`radiotwr`/`transmitter`
  collapse, every `gullfly`): as an absolute that is a *negative* scale, i.e. the piece inside-out at
  a tenth of its size and effectively invisible; as an offset it is a clean 10 % shrink. Confirmed
  visually — killing C1's `ap_h2otwr1` under the absolute reading leaves only the legs standing (the
  tank and roof sections vanish), under the offset reading the tank tumbles away intact. The crash
  `dust` ramps (4.5,11,4.5) → (3.5,6,3.5) over 6 s. ⚠ The base is 1, and whether it should instead be
  the node's own authored scale is **undecided**: every node carrying this channel is authored at
  exactly unit scale in this install, so the two readings coincide and nothing can separate them.

Verified 2026-07-23 in `--anim-lab --play-anim=player_crash_dirt` (seeded, fixed-dt): the five
`fly_trail*` debris anchors integrate outward and the two carrying `FORWARD_ROTATION` tumble while
the others do not (those two are `TRANSLATION_RANGE` launches; the crash's own `pieceN`, which fly
the vector form, stopped tumbling on 2026-08-13), `dust` runs a scale ramp and an `OpacityFade` at once, `flydirt` sinks on its
`TRANSLATION`. An 8-chapter ambient regression is byte-identical bar C3's one reachable opacity
fade — because nothing ambient fires the ballistic half (see the reachability boundary above).

What the reachable spins are: 576 of 590 are zeppelin nacelle propellers — `spin` at −40°/s and
`counterspin` at +30°/s about local Z, counter-rotating — plus rotating signage (`ammosign`,
`jsign` at 24°/s about Y) and a few `prop`/`rotor` pairs. The companion `propoff` sequence
deactivates the static `propstill` disc and activates the `spin`/`counterspin` blur meshes: the
same static-disc-vs-blur-layer split `PlaneBuilder` already does for the player's own aircraft.

**Units diverge between the front-ends, as usual.** The reader writes one flat six-number list
in **degrees/second**, `XYZ_ROTATION [0, 0, -40, 0, 0, 0]` = initial triple then delta triple;
the compiled form nests it as `{initial:{x,y,z}, delta:{x,y,z}}` in **radians/second**
(−0.6981317 = −40°). Converted once in `AnimDefs.Spin`, the same way `PLAYER_RANGE` (m vs m²)
and `ANIMATION_LOD` (`HIGH` vs `2`) are.

**`initial` is a rate, not a pose** — the question worth settling, since `delta` is zero in 589
of the 590 reachable events, which would make them all *static* under a pose reading. The
autogyro's destruction tumble writes `XYZ_ROTATION [55, 20, -175, 0, 0, 0]` on a wreck falling
under `GRAVITY [COMPLEX, DO_INTERSECTIONS]`; a falling wreck with a fixed pose is not a thing,
and the sequences are named `spin_rotor`. Verified in flight: the rendered prop advances
−40.5°/−81.0° at 1 s/2 s, i.e. exactly the authored −40°/s.

**`delta` is NOT decoded and is deliberately not guessed.** It reads as acceleration on a blown
chassis (`+15°/s` added to a 30°/s spin), as a *decelerating* ramp on `chuteman_sway`
(initial `(-10,0,10)`, delta `(+10,0,-10)`, `RUN_TIME` 2 — a parachutist swaying back), and
could equally be a random spread, which this data uses elsewhere. Nothing reachable needs it, so
it is counted as `ObjectMotion(rotation delta)` and reported — the same call `Object3DRotate`'s
ambiguous angle unit got in `interp.md`.

### Transform channels are absolute; rotations are radians compiled, degrees in the sources

**Every transform channel — `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`, in both the `*_STATE` events and
`OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO` — is an absolute value in the node's own parent frame, not an offset
from its authored rest pose.** Nothing in this data is relative: the `*_delta` channels that
look like they would be are the same tween's rate — see the `*_delta` section just below.

Evidence, surveyed over all 8 chapters (2026-07-21):

- C1's `mafia` car moves `from (-6796, 128, -5958) to (-6521, 128, -5958)`; its gamez node's
  authored translate is `(-6795.828, 128.0, -5956.72)` and its parent is the `world1` root.
  Adding the channel to the rest pose put the C1 traffic at `(-13574, 256, -11914)` — exactly
  double, y included — i.e. ~7 km off the map.
- C5's `m_gerter` crane hook moves between `(21.3, 19.9, -20.2)` and `(21.3, 7.9, -20.2)`,
  small numbers because its parent is `m_crane`. C1's `sinker` moves `(0,0,0) → (0,-7.5,3.5)`
  in its parent boat's frame.
- For `OBJECT_TRANSLATE_STATE`, 627 of the resolvable uses have `STATE` **exactly equal to**
  the node's authored rest translate — the doubling case again. The 367 zero-valued uses are
  no-ops only because those nodes rest at the origin.
- "Does `from` match the node's rest pose" is a **bad test**: nodes whose animation is what
  places them (C2's `sailboat2`, C1's `car_go_home`) rest at their parent's origin and
  legitimately don't match. Absolute-in-parent-frame is the rule that covers both families.

Rotation units differ between the two spellings (2026-08-04, the C2 roadblock spin):

- **Compiled** archives are **radians**: the maximum magnitude in that data is `15.708 = 5π`,
  99.93% of values are ≤ 2π, and 228 sit on exact π/2 multiples. Converting them with
  `DegToRad` makes every rotation ~57× too small — visually, nothing turns.
- **Reader (zrdr) sources** are **degrees** — the same reader↔compiled divergence as
  `XYZ_ROTATION`, `PLAYER_RANGE` (m vs m²) and `ANIMATION_LOD` (`HIGH` vs `2`). Surveyed over
  every `.zrd.json` in the install: 1,388 of 1,428 nonzero `OBJECT_ROTATE_STATE`/`ROTATE_FROM`/
  `ROTATE_TO` values exceed 2π, maximum 900, on clean multiples of 5°/15°/45°. C2
  `police_blockade`'s `[0,135,0]` against its compiled `mis_anim` twin's `2.3561945` (= 135°)
  settles it — fed through unconverted, the roadblock swerve spun each car ~9 turns. The
  remake's reader front-end (`AnimDefs`) converts at parse, so handlers see radians from both.

**An absent `OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO` channel means HOLD the node's current value**, not
"return to the authored rest pose" — the reader spelling's "a missing FROM means from
wherever the object currently is", generalised to the whole channel. Surveyed install-wide:
883 of 1,802 FROM_TO events carry no rotate channel, and on 89 of them (26 nodes) the held
value differs from rest — C1's traffic and firetrucks, C2's ten studebakers, its sailboats
and yachts (up to `sailboat1`'s 300 s leg held 180° from rest). Seeded from rest, C1's
`black_car1` (one ROTSTATE 180° then a single 16 s translate-only loop) drives its whole
route exactly sideways.

### `*_delta` is the same channel's RATE, not a second motion

Decoded 2026-08-04 from an install-wide census of all 16,114 compiled anim files
(`analysis/bl-050-fromto-delta/`). The compiled `*_delta` channels arrive as a bare `{x,y,z}`
vector, **not** a `{from,to}` pair, on **51** events (15 `translate_delta`, 17 `rotate_delta`,
19 `scale_delta`; 29 in `cam_anim`, 22 in `mis_anim`; 33 distinct authored signatures). The
reader sources spell no `*_DELTA` token at all — 0 of 1,355 reader JSON files contain the
substring — so this is a compiled-form-only field.

**`*_delta == (channel.to − channel.from) / run_time`**, i.e. the sibling absolute channel's
per-second rate, precomputed by the original's compiler. Verified against all 51: zero
mismatches, worst relative residual 4e-6 (float32 rounding), and **every one of the 51 ships
the absolute channel it is the rate of** — there is no event the delta alone describes. It
holds on the awkward cases too, which is what settles it: C3's `studebaker4` swerve carries a
non-axis-aligned rotate `(−0.7156, 0.8552, 0) → (−0.5236, −0.5236, 0)` over 0.35 s and a delta
of `(0.5485, −3.9395, 0)`; C5's `litemast_dest`/`wire2` scales `(1,1,1) → (0.7, 0.1, 8)` over
2.2 s with a delta of `(−0.1364, −0.4091, 3.1818)`.

⚠ **So a consumer must NOT read it.** It carries no information the tween does not already
have, and composing it as an extra offset — the reading a bare vector invites, "the `to` with
an implied zero `from`" — runs every one of these 51 motions at double speed. CSVM reads the
three absolute channels only (`FromToMotion`); the delta plumbing was removed 2026-08-04 so a
later reader who notices a `{from,to}` parser returning `(null, null)` on a bare vector does
not "fix" it back.

### `IF`/`ELSEIF` conditions are all evaluable

Ten condition kinds appear across the install. None of them is opaque gameplay state that a
world build has no value for — an earlier reading, which led the runtime to skip every
branch. **All ten are evaluated as of 2026-07-21** (`AnimRuntime.EvaluateCondition`).

⚠ **The engine has fourteen, and the missing four are unused data, not unimplemented code.**
`PLAYER_UNDERCOVER`, `PLAYER_BELOW_ALT`, `PLAYER_LINED_UP` and `PLAYER_SPEED` have parser branches
and evaluator branches in `crimson.exe` and are authored nowhere in the install (swept 2026-08-13,
0 occurrences against 1,097 for `PLAYER_RANGE`). The full bit-to-token table is in
[`org/sequences.md`](../org/sequences.md); this table is the census of what ships, and the two do
not disagree.

The compiled payload is a one-key union under `data.If.condition`, e.g.
`{"AnimationLod": 2}`; the reader spells the same conditions with its own vocabulary and, for
two of them, **different units** — that conversion happens once, in `AnimDefs.ReaderCondition`,
so the runtime has a single convention.

| Count | Condition | Reader spelling | Rule used |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 4537 | `RandomWeight` (0..1) | `RANDOM_WEIGHT [w]` | `draw <= w`, re-rolled per evaluation. The original draws from a 200-entry ring that is itself `rand()`-filled per run, so there is no sequence to match — see [`org/sequences.md`](../org/sequences.md)'s condition flag word. |
| 4007 | `AnimHealth` | `ANIM_HEALTH [n]` | `health <= n` — "worn down to n". Full health in a world build, so uniformly false. |
| 1052 | `PlayerRange` | `PLAYER_RANGE [m]` | `dist²(anchor, player) <= value`. **Compiled is metres SQUARED** (reader 270 ↔ compiled 72900, exact across the install; the parser squares it, confirmed in the exe). No scale factor rides on the comparison. |
| 717 | `NodeActive` | `NODE_ACTIVE [name]` | the node is visible. Compiled carries an INDEX, reader a name — see below. |
| 473 | `NodeUndercover` | `NODE_NEAR_GROUND [name, d]` | **stubbed false** — needs a ground/occlusion probe. All 473 sit in `ON_CALL` defs the bootstrap never reaches. |
| 124 | `AnimHealthRange` | — | `min <= health <= max`. Same as `AnimHealth`: false at full health. |
| 120 | `AnimationLod` | `ANIMATION_LOD [HIGH]` | `ourLod >= n`. **Our setting, not the data's** — see below. |
| 120 | `PlayerFirstPerson` | `PLAYER_1ST_PERSON` | our camera mode; false until a cockpit view exists. |
| 28 | `NodeBelowAlt` | `NODE_BELOW_ALT [name, alt]` | node world Y < alt. |
| 17 | `HwRender` | `HW_RENDER` | true. |

`HW_RENDER` and `PLAYER_1ST_PERSON` take **no reader argument** and every compiled instance
stores `false` in the shared 4-byte value slot, so that slot is unused for them and the
condition is the runtime flag itself. (The one piece of counter-evidence is C1B's
`four_bulletholes`, whose branches read backwards under that rule — but it is an `ON_CALL`
player-cockpit def that never runs in a world build, so nothing turns on it.)

`AnimationLod` is a **quality setting**: 2 is the only value anywhere in the install (the
reader spells it `HIGH`), so the project defaults to 2 and every LOD-gated branch passes —
the hardware has no reason to hide detail the original hid only for performance.
`--anim-lod=N` lowers it for A/B comparison.

**Condition node references are 1-based indices into the definition's own `nodes` support
array**, not gamez node indices and not names — mech3ax resolves index→name for every other
event kind but leaves conditions raw. Two negative sentinels ride in the same u32 field:
`-100` `MAIN_ROOT_NODE` and `-200` `INPUT_NODE` (arriving as 4294967196 / 4294967096), both
meaning "the node this definition was invoked on" = the anchor. float32 JSON parsing cannot
tell those two apart, which does not matter since they resolve identically.

This matters because the branches gate real content: C1's `refinery_fire_always` and
`ref_light_always1..6` wrap their entire light sequence in `If { AnimationLod: 2 }`,
`litehouse_sparking` gates its spark bursts on `If { RandomWeight: 0.7 }`, and C1/MP1's
`rearm_node_1/call_door` is a **poll** — `If { PlayerRange: 625 } → CallAnimation; Endif;
Loop{-1}` — that fires the rearm-bay door when the player closes to 25 m. Skipping branches
meant none of it ran.

That poll idiom pins down one more semantic: **`CALL_ANIMATION` does not restart an animation
that is already running** on the same anchor. The call is re-issued every frame the condition
holds, so restarting would freeze the 2 s door at its first frame for as long as you hover.

**The forward skip counts no nesting depth, and nesting ships.** `FUN_004ec080`, on a false
condition, walks forward event by event and breaks at the **first** `ELSE` (0x20), `ELSEIF` (0x21)
or `ENDIF` (0x22) — landing on an `ELSEIF` it loads that condition and re-tests it in the same loop;
landing on anything else it returns and the stepper steps past. The `ELSE`/`ELSEIF` fall-through
(`004ec5a0`, shared by both opcodes) likewise scans to the first `ENDIF`. Neither keeps a depth
counter, and `ENDIF` (`004ec5d0`) is inert, so a nested chain is not skipped over — it is walked
into. **48 sequences nest**, all one shape, in every chapter's `gunhit-*slug_gunhit` and
`mag_gunhit-*` — played on every gun impact:

```
If AnimationLod 2 / If PlayerRange 1000000 / If RandomWeight 0.2
    LIGHT_STATE gunhit_lt (range 0.5..21.25) ; OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE gunhit_lt off
Elseif RandomWeight 0.2
    LIGHT_STATE gunhit_lt (range 0.9..12.25) ; OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE gunhit_lt off
Else Endif / Else Endif / Endif
```

Both `ELSE` bodies are empty, which is what makes the missing depth counter observable: a false
`ANIMATION_LOD` or a false `PLAYER_RANGE` lands on the inner `ELSEIF` and **re-tests it**, so the
dimmer impact light still fires on its 20 % roll with either outer gate failed. A nesting-aware
reading skips the whole block and fires nothing. The original's reading is the one CSVM runs
(`SequenceRunner.Scan`); it reads like a compiler bug and it is the shipped behaviour.

No `RESET_STATE` in either source contains control flow (verified across the install), so the
instantaneous base-state pass never has to interpret a branch.

Playback ops seen and deferred: `OBJECT_DELETE_CHILD`,
`SOUND` (the one-shot form — see below), `OBJECT_CYCLE_TEXTURE`, `CAMERA_STATE`,
`CALLBACK`, `DETONATE_WEAPON`.
(`FBFX_COLOR_FROM_TO` landed — see [`org/sequences.md`](../org/sequences.md)'s
"FBFX_COLOR_FROM_TO is a full-screen wash";
`LIGHT_STATE`/`LIGHT_ANIMATION` landed 2026-07-21 — see below;
`SOUND_NODE` + the sound half of `OBJECT_ADD_CHILD` landed 2026-07-22 — see "SOUND_NODE is a
three-event triple"; `OBJECT_MOTION`'s rotation half landed 2026-07-22 and its
ballistic/scale/tumble half 2026-07-23 — see "OBJECT_MOTION is two ops in one";
`OBJECT_OPACITY_STATE` landed 2026-07-22 and `OBJECT_OPACITY_FROM_TO` 2026-07-23 — see
"OBJECT_OPACITY_STATE is translucency".)

`CALL_ANIMATION` dispatched from the start but **ignored its target node** until 2026-07-21 —
see "CALL_ANIMATION carries a target node" below; that is the data's template-instancing
mechanism and `OBJECT_ADD_CHILD` is **not** (surveyed: the fire templates are never its
children, and 75% of its 1,152 uses attach sound *definitions* rather than nodes).

## `CALL_ANIMATION` carries a target node — this is the template-instancing mechanism

Surveyed and implemented 2026-07-21. A call may name **another node to run the callee on**,
and that is how one authored definition serves many sites. Three spellings, two shapes:

| Reader | Compiled | Uses |
|---|---|---|
| `WITH_NODE [name]` | `parameters: {"WithNode": {node, position}}` | 29,633 |
| `AT_NODE [name]` | `parameters: {"AtNode": {node, position, translate}}` | 7,640 |
| `OPERAND_NODE [name]` | `operand_node: "name"` (bare, not nested) | 179 |

`parameters` is a one-key union, so `AnimData.Union()` reads it directly. The reader front-end
normalizes `WITH_NODE`/`AT_NODE` into the compiled shape (`AnimDefs.AddCallTarget`) so the
runtime has a single path. **The target is written in the CALLER's namespace** and resolves
through the caller's definition and scope.

Why it matters, with the case that proves it: C1/M05's eight zeppelin engines each run
`stop_wvzreng1..4`/`stop_wvzleng1..4`, and each calls the **generic** definition `gen_zep`/
`random_prop` — whose whole body is "rotate the node named `propstill` to a random angle" —
targeting its own `propstill`. Ignore the target and all eight calls resolve `propstill`
globally to whichever one is first, so eight engines share one prop angle. Honour it and each
engine gets its own. The same mechanism is what places effect templates:
`CALL_ANIMATION [NAME [huge_30sec_fire], WITH_NODE [rc*_dbase1]]` burns one ship section.

Two implementation notes. Instance identity is `(definition, anchor)`, so retargeting is also
what lets one definition run concurrently on many sites — the `IsLive` check must use the
**resolved** anchor, not the caller's, or the second site is swallowed as a duplicate. And an
unresolvable target falls back to the caller's anchor rather than dropping the call, so a node
the builder skipped cannot make an effect vanish; the fallback is counted and reported.

**There is no alternate call-target index form.** Animations are dispatched by name string
everywhere in this data — relevant because the four `fire.zrd.json` definitions are called by
nothing (see below). The compiled wait index described next is symbol-table bookkeeping for that
same named callee, not another way to choose the target.

### `WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION` blocks on the named callee

The reader's bare `WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION` token makes a call synchronous: the caller's sequence does
not advance past the call until that callee completes. Compiled e24 stores flag `0x10` plus a
zero-based index into the **caller's** `anim_refs` table. The index does not select a different
connector: across all **3,731** flagged `CallAnimation` events, every index is in range and every
indexed ref names the call's own `name` (including all 92 nonzero indices). Thus `0` and `null` are
different authored states: `0` waits for ref zero; `null` has no wait flag and returns immediately.

Install-wide compiled distribution: `null` ×53,019, `0` ×3,639, `1` ×32, `2` ×19, `5` ×16,
`3` ×9, `4` ×8, `6` ×8. The reader sources carry the bare token on 147 `CALL_ANIMATION` bodies and
33 local `CALL_SEQUENCE` bodies. The e24 slot also contains **unflagged stale values** in Crimson
Skies; the fork exposes those separately as `wait_for_raw` (525 non-null events), and consumers
must not treat them as waits. Census and the 92-row dump instrument:
`analysis/wait-for-completion/`.

**The hold gates the caller's NEXT event — it is not a lifetime hold on the sequence.** Implemented
2026-08-05 (`BL-228`), and the scope is the data's, not a decision: censusing what each flagged call
is asked to wait FOR (`analysis/wait-for-completion/`, `callee_shapes.py`) splits the 2,852 flagged
calls in the blocks the runtime executes into a cross-tab with an empty cell.

| | callee never terminates | callee terminates |
|---|---:|---:|
| flagged call is the LAST event of its block | 2,662 | 25 |
| flagged call has events behind it | **0** | **165** |

Every flagged call naming a callee that never finishes is the last event of its block, and there
are only four such callees — `sputter_fire`, `sputter_black_smoke`, `sputter_fire_smoke`,
`gen_drop_ladder`, the `LOOP{-1}` sustain idiom. The reader front-end reproduces the same one-sided
split independently over its own 147 flagged bodies. Read as a lifetime hold, 2,770 authored calls
would wedge their sequence open forever; read as a next-event gate, the install is consistent with
zero exceptions. So only **165 calls (5.8 %), in 29 distinct (caller, callee) pairs**, can shift any
timing — median authored hold 3.0 s, longest 36.01 s (`start_gb3` → `cg1zepright_gasbag3`).

"Completes" is the callee's INSTANCE ending — every non-`OnCall` sequence it started plus everything
those reached by `CALL_SEQUENCE`, which is what makes the hold outlast the call's own t=0 burst. A
call that reaches no live instance (a callee whose whole choreography fires at t=0 — 16 of the 165)
holds for nothing, by design.

**Decode status: confirmed at the state-machine level, not pinned to a `CALL_ANIMATION`-specific
address.** A handler returning **1** ("still running") from the stepper `FUN_004ecbb0` keeps the
caller re-dispatching the same event every tick without advancing — exactly the "gates the caller's
next event, not a lifetime hold" behaviour this census derived independently from data. The
`CALL_ANIMATION` dispatch slot's own handler address was not individually decoded (see the opcode
table in [`org/sequences.md`](../org/sequences.md)), so this is confirmed by the general contract
every handler obeys, not by reading the wait-specific code.

All flagged compiled owners are `OnCall` (2,844) or `WeaponHit` (8 in these blocks), never
`OnStartup`, so no ambient world boot arms one — measured: an 8-chapter `--freecam` regression arms
zero holds and leaves every bootstrap count identical. The clearest timing case is
`player_crash_water`, where flagged `plane_big_splash` precedes `large_steam_spray`. **That case is
reachable as of 2026-08-02** (surface-aware crash selection), and a captured sea dive showed the
divergence directly: the two retargeted on the *same tick*, so the steam spray started with the
splash instead of after it. The splash's own choreography runs 3.0 s (`plane_sp_polys`' scale +
`plane_sp_polyfade`' opacity ramp); the landed hold measures **3.050 s** on real gamez data
(`wait-for-completion` suite). It is the only crash def in the install carrying the flag — the eight
chapters' `player_crash_default`/`player_crash_dirt` are all `null`.

One spelling is counted and deliberately NOT honoured: 33 reader `CALL_SEQUENCE` bodies carry the
bare token, which the compiled form never does (56,750/56,750 of the field's occurrences are on
`CallAnimation`) and so has no decoded semantics. The 879 flagged calls in the `unknown_seq`
destruction slot dispatch since `BL-276` (2026-08-05) — the slot is loaded as
`AnimDefinition.DeathSlot` and runs at death (see [destructibles.md](destructibles.md)), so its
flags behave like any dispatched call's (a routed effect call's hold is counted, not honoured).

**An `OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE` pair around a call is a scope, not a lifetime.** The data's idiom for
"emit here" is three events with no `START_TIME` between them — activate a bare node, call the
emitter definition onto it, switch the node off again — and the author means the emitter to keep
running: the four splash definitions (`big_splash`, `huge_splash`, `med_splash`,
`plane_big_splash`, all on `sp_1`) wrap `hg_splasher`, which authors a 0.5 s `STOP_SEQUENCE` plus its
own `PUFFER_STATE 0` 0.1 s later. An absent `START_TIME` gates the moment the previous event
completes — not, as the encoding might suggest, `EVENT_OFFSET 0` (see "Event scheduling" below) —
so all three land in one instant regardless, and a consumer that reads the deactivation as "stop the
emitters here" kills the effect on the tick it starts. The same-shaped pair a few seconds APART
means the opposite and is the far
larger population — a `partN` activated, given a debris trail, flown by a 3.5–5 s `OBJECT_MOTION`
and only then switched off, where that deactivation is the trail's ONLY authored stop. Censused
install-wide (`analysis/bl-229-emitter-host-deactivation/`): 414 pairs, 32 same-instant in 4 shapes
against 382 a median 3.5 s later, smallest later gap 1 ms, nothing in between. The reader source
carries the triple by hand, so it is an authoring idiom rather than a compiler artefact.

**Placing an effect template means moving its root.** An effect template hosts its puffers on
its OWN root subtree — `small_yellow_sparks`' puffer `at_node` is `yellow_spark_01`,
`call_crash_trails`' are `fly_trail1..5` — so re-scoping the callee's name resolution to the
call target is not enough: the template's root node must be relocated to the call site, or the
effect emits at the template's authored gamez origin. `AT_NODE`'s `position` is an offset in the
target node's frame, added to the site (world position is what matters — the puffers key off the
host origin). The original instantiates by *copying* the template mesh; a consumer that relocates
the single shared template instead must expect overlapping same-template calls to collapse onto
the last site.

**The offset triple needs no axis swap: it is already `(x, y, z)` in the mesh frame** — right-handed,
Y up, nose −Z, exactly the convention [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) settles for coordinates. Censused
over all 6,728 `AT_NODE`-style positions in the install (`analysis/at-node-axis-order/`), across
every event kind that carries one: `CALL_ANIMATION`'s `parameters.AtNode.position`, `PUFFER_STATE`'s
`translate`, `LIGHT_STATE`/`SOUND_NODE`'s `translate.AtNode.pos`, `SOUND`/`DETONATE_WEAPON`'s
`at_node.pos`, and the reader's flat `AT_NODE [name, dx, dy, dz]`. 770 of them can tell a Y-up read
apart from a Z-up one, and the data is one-sided: `wv_turrets.zrd`'s `wvutur*`/`wvctur*` are the
same definition differing only in the sign of the middle component, applied to turrets sitting at
y ≈ +43…+57 on the gasbags versus y ≈ −30…−82 under a parent named `underneath` — the middle
component tracks up/down. `he_ground_effect` lifts its fireball 12 m over a ring whose mesh is
0.1 m thick; `muzzle_burst_*` puts its flash 1 m along −Z, out of the barrel; `shipsink` spreads
seven explosions over 165 m of a 231 m hull at constant height. **A reading that is 8 m too high is
therefore authored, not mis-parsed** — look at where the def's host was staged, not at the axes.

## `STOP_SEQUENCE` halts the named sequence, and does nothing else

The wire format is identical to `CALL_SEQUENCE` — a 36-byte struct carrying only the name — and so
is the name resolution. `004eb610` resolves the name to an index in the definition's own sequence
array and then unconditionally writes that sequence's state byte to **2 (done)**. There is no
start-if-not-running path anywhere in the handler.

**`STOP_SEQUENCE [NAME [x]]`: halt every active runner of sequence `x` on this instance —
including the sequence carrying the event.** Because `CALL_SEQUENCE` can only start a sequence
from the parked state (3), stopping an `ON_CALL` sequence that was never called *disables* it: no
later call reaches it until the whole definition resets. Two authored idioms use the halt, and a
third — the "stopper" — turns out to author a teardown that never runs:

- **Break** (`test_player`×33, `setprop`×8): a sequence stops *itself* inside an `IF` branch —
  `random_prop` picks one of 8 random prop rotations and `STOP_SEQUENCE [setprop]` ends the
  taken pass so the remaining branches never evaluate. Requires the halt reading on self.
- **Halt a running sibling** (`large_30sec_fire`'s `fire_n_smoke`, `zepskinfire`×5,
  `flame_light_seq`): the target is genuinely running — a `LOOP -1` poll or a sequence started
  earlier by `CALL_SEQUENCE`. The halt is load-bearing beyond bookkeeping: a `PUFFER_STATE`
  re-assert *revives* a stopped emitter (the damage-stage sputter contract), so the
  `PUFFER_STATE INACTIVE` these stops pair with cannot end the fire alone — the un-halted poll
  would re-light it one frame later.
- **Stopper** (`flame_ball.zrd`'s `stop_p1trail`): the target is `ACTIVATION ON_CALL`, not
  running at fire time, and its body is pure teardown (`PUFFER_STATE … INACTIVE`,
  `OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE … INACTIVE`). The 2026-08-01 survey read this as a fall-through to a call,
  on the strength of the same file reaching the same sequence by a literal
  `CALL_SEQUENCE [stop_p1trail]` elsewhere (`moving_fire_ball_01`'s `fly_flare`). The exe says
  otherwise: the stop marks it done and the teardown never dispatches. The two events are *not*
  interchangeable — a call reaches a stopper, a stop buries it. **16 definitions** author this
  (`flame_ball_01`/`flame_ball_02` → `stop_p1trail`, in all 8 chapters), and the effects those
  sequences would have switched off are instead left to their own authored lifetimes.

Halting a runner never retracts what its events already launched — motions, puffers and lights
run out their own authored lifetimes (the same independence that keeps a rocket ring's scale
motion alive after its launching sequence ends).

⚠ **CSVM does not persist the disable.** It halts matching runners and reports whether the name
resolved; it does not remember that a sequence was stopped, so a later `CALL_SEQUENCE` still
starts it where the original's done state would refuse. 123 definitions name one sequence in both
a call and a stop (mostly `flame_light_seq`), but whether any of them reaches the stop *before*
the call at run time is a control-flow question the static census cannot answer.

## Fire: a texture cycle on a material, and behaviours nothing calls

Decoded 2026-07-21 while chasing the user's "there is a fire flipbook at the refinery" report;
**the mechanism was re-decoded out of `crimson.exe` on 2026-08-13 and the earlier reading of it
was wrong** (see "What changed" below). Three separate layers, none of which is
`OBJECT_ADD_CHILD`:

- **Templates.** `fire1`/`fire2` (C1 nodes 494/496) sit under the **parentless roots**
  `fire1.flt`/`fire2.flt` (493/495), real single-polygon `Facade`/`CylindricalY` meshes on
  materials 88/133 (`fire101.tif`/`fire102.tif`). They are not chapter geometry:
  `support\load.gw` lines 357/360 load them from `common\effects\models\`, and every *other*
  effect root (`large_firetrail`, `lg_fireball`, `flame_ball_01`, `fire_here`, `zep_skin_fire1`–`4`)
  is loaded from `dummy.flt`, i.e. is an empty anchor that draws nothing by construction.
  `WorldBuilder` builds only World children plus partition-referenced subtrees, so none of them
  is ever in the scene.
- **The flipbook, `effects.zrd.json`.** `["fire1.flt", NAME ["fire1"], SPEED [10.0], LOOPING
  ["ON"], MAPS [fire101.tif … fire112.tif]]` and `fire2` with 6 maps @ 5 fps. Exactly two entries
  exist install-wide. The maps resolve **by filename against the texture archive**, not through
  the gamez texture table: every chapter's `textures.json` registers only `fire101`/`fire102`,
  while `extracted/<ch>/texture/` ships all twelve `fire1NN.png`.
- **Behaviours, `fire.zrd.json`.** Four `ON_CALL` definitions, **all anchored on `fire2.flt`**:
  `timed_big_fire`, `persistent_big_fire`, `persistent_small_fire`, `timed_small_fire`. They
  scale the template up and back down and flicker a `big_fire_light`.

### The flipbook is state on the MATERIAL, and the material is shared

`zeff_ini.c`'s reader (`FUN_00523ac0`) resolves the entry's node name, walks down to the first
mesh under it (`FUN_00525d40`), takes surface 0's material, and installs the frame list on the
**material record** through `gmod_matl.c`'s `SetCycleTextureCount/Map/Loop/Speed`
(`FUN_0055b0c0`/`0055b160`/`0055b280`/`0055b2c0`). The material's cycle block hangs off `+0x24`:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | looping |
| `+0x04` | frame stamp (the global frame counter this material last advanced on) |
| `+0x08` | accumulated time |
| `+0x0c` | speed, frames/sec (15.0 until `SPEED` overwrites it) |
| `+0x10` | frame count |
| `+0x14` | fill count, while the maps are being appended |
| `+0x18` | the texture-handle array |

`SetCycleTextureCount` sets `0x100` (textured) and `0x400` (cycled) in the material's own flag
word. The polygon draw loop (`FUN_005524d0`) tests that word per polygon, calls the advance
(`FUN_0055b1a0`) when `0x400` is set, and samples the material's live texture at `+0x10`. The
advance is `mat[+0x10] = tex_array[ftol(acc) % count]; acc += dt * speed`, guarded by the frame
stamp so it runs at most once per material per frame.

**So a flipbook reaches every polygon that references the material, not the node that named it.**
Materials are one record per texture (C1's 570-entry table has exactly one duplicate pair), and
the gamez zbd is a memory snapshot (records carry live `cycle_ptr`/`tex_map_ptr`/`current_frame`,
polygons carry `matl_refs_ptr`), so that sharing is the runtime state, not a file-format artifact.
Material 88 is referenced by four models: `fire1` (the template), `flame01` (the refinery vent,
node 2998 under `vent1` → `refinery.flt` → `refinery` → `world1`), `mb1` and `mb_spinflame`.
Material 133 is used by `fire2` alone.

`fire1.flt` is therefore a **proxy node**: it exists to name a material, exactly like the interp
scripts' `watersetup`/`surfsetup` (`support\<ch>\tex_fx.gw`), which install the water, surf, wake,
turbulence and walking-crowd cycles through the same four setters via the
`CycleTextureSetOn/Speed/Looping/Map` commands in `zinterp.c` (`FUN_005b80a0`). The interp also
has `CreateUniqueMaterials` for the case where sharing is *not* wanted; `support\cockpit.gw` is
the only caller, de-sharing the gauge materials so each instrument indexes its own frame set
(those run at `SPEED 0`, i.e. a frame set the game indexes explicitly rather than a flipbook).

### What changed, 2026-08-13

The 2026-07-21 reading said "EFFECTS binds to the NODE, not the texture or material", concluded
that `flame01` is a static base flame, and that the animated fire the user saw was a placed
`fire2` instance. The draw loop settles it the other way: **`flame01` plays `fire101` to `fire112`
at 10 fps from load, with no trigger and no placement**, and `mb1`/`mb_spinflame` play the same
cycle in lockstep because the frame stamp gives every polygon on material 88 the identical frame.

The observation that drove the old reading, a sustained muzzle flash never leaving `fire101`,
is contradicted by the code. It is not a strong observation either way: `mb_spinflame` is a small
three-polygon sprite that is already spinning and flashing, and the twelve `fire1NN` frames are
variations of one shape rather than a sequence with obvious motion. **The clean A/B is the
refinery vent**, which is a still object where the frames should visibly roll.

### The behaviours are still triggerless

All four `fire.zrd.json` names appear in exactly one file, their own. No compiled archive, no
other reader, and there is no index-based call form. `CATCHES_FIRE` is a real ZWEP weapon key
(`zwep_ini.c` `FUN_005ad630`, flag bit 13) but **no weapon in this install sets it**, so it is not
the missing trigger either. The original invokes them engine-side, so reproducing a *damaged
object catching fire* still requires choosing our own trigger. The always-on refinery flame does
not: it is the material cycle above, and CSVM installs it in `EffectCycles`.

## `LIGHT_STATE` / `LIGHT_ANIMATION` — the world's point lights

Surveyed across the whole install 2026-07-21: **1,468 `LIGHT_STATE` events, every one of them
`type_: "PointSource"`** — no directional or spot lights exist in this data. A definition's
`lights` array is its symbol table for them, exactly as `objects`/`nodes` are for geometry, so
a light name is scoped to the definition instance (two refineries each own an `orange_light`).

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `name` | Index into the def's own `lights` array. |
| `active_state` | On/off. true 1147× / false 321×. |
| `translate` | `{AtNode:{name,pos}}` (761×) or null (707×) — a gamez node plus a local offset, the same shape and frame as a puffer's `AT_NODE`. |
| `range` | `{min,max}` — full brightness inside `min`, nothing past `max`. Present on exactly the 1147 "on" events. **Every startup light in this install has a `max` between 2 and 22 m.** |
| `color` | `{r,g,b}`, present 765×. A DX7 sRGB value, so it needs linearising like `FOG_COLOR`. |
| `directional`, `saturated`, `subdivide`, `lightmap`, `static_`, `bicolored`, `orientation`, `ambient*`, `diffuse` | Null or false almost everywhere; nothing in this install depends on them. |

**The load-bearing semantic is that a `LIGHT_STATE` is a PARTIAL update.** A fire or refinery
flicker is a stream of `{name, range}` events 0.03–0.07 s apart that must leave position,
colour and active state untouched — the reader spells this the same way
(`"LIGHT_STATE", ["NAME", […], "RANGE", […]]` and nothing else). The compiled nulls line up
exactly: `range` is null on precisely the 321 events that switch a light *off*. So a handler
must apply only the fields present and never default the absent ones. 66 reader files also
carry `LIGHT_STATE`, so the zrdr front-end needs the same normalizer (`AnimDefs.AddLightState`)
— skipping it would repeat the `PUFFER_STATE` bug in a subtler form.

`LIGHT_ANIMATION` (535 events) ramps a light over `run_time`, and its `range`/`color` are
**signed deltas, not targets**: C1B's `ap_light` pulse runs `{min +50, max +160}` over 0.1 s
then `{min −50, max −160}` over 0.05 s, and a negative range is not a value a light can hold.
The reader's `RANGE` carries four numbers (`[min, max, altMin, altMax]`) where the compiled
form splits the trailing pair into `range_alt` (null throughout this install).

**The ramp is the event's DURATION — it holds its sequence** (decoded 2026-08-10, D31). The
handler is dispatch slot 5, `004e82b0`. On its first dispatch (`seq+0x20 == 0`, i.e. state
*starting*) it copies the authored per-second deltas into the event's working slots
(`+0x30/0x34 → +0x40/0x44` for the range pair, `+0x48/0x4c/0x50 → +0x60/0x64/0x68` for the
colour triple); on every dispatch it reads the light's current range and colour back out of the
light object, adds one tick's worth of delta, clamps each colour channel to `0…1` and writes
them back — with the last tick shortened to the remainder (`dt − (event_timer − run_time)`) so
the ramp lands exactly on its end value. It then ends
`return (seq->event_timer < run_time) ? 1 : 2` — **still running until the run time is up**,
which is the same gate `FBFX_COLOR_FROM_TO` (`004ec6a0`) uses and the same one the
handler-return state machine above describes.

So a chain of `LIGHT_ANIMATION`s is a *timed* chain, not a burst. CSVM ramps the light
asynchronously instead (`AnimLight.TweenLeft`, ticked in `AnimRuntime.TickLights`), which draws
the same picture **only if the sequence is also held** — and until D31 it was not: the handler
reported duration 0, so every step of a chain fired in one instant and each re-armed the tween
the previous one had just started. The observable cost was total, not subtle. C1's `red_police`
(`police_lights`) authors `LIGHT_STATE` red `{0…10}` / `LIGHT_ANIMATION {max +40}` over 0.25 s /
`LIGHT_ANIMATION {max −40}` over 0.1 s / `LOOP −1` — a 0.35 s flashing beacon. Collapsed, the
two ramps cancelled each other every animation frame and the police light did not flash at all;
held, it flashes at its authored rate (and the `LOOP −1` paces off the ramps instead of running
one instantaneous pass per `AnimFrame`). `he_ground_effect`'s `he_light_seq` is the same shape
with seven ramps over 0.41 s.

**Which chapters actually light anything:** only **C1**. It is the sole chapter with
`OnStartup` definitions containing `LIGHT_STATE` (36 of them — the refinery flare, six
docklights, six reflights, the police light); every other chapter's light events sit in
`ON_CALL` combat/destruction effects (`gunhit_lt`, `muzzle_lt`, `fuel_light`) that a bootstrap
never reaches. C1 reports 35 lights at startup, growing to ~57 as delayed and looping
sequences fire.

**What a point light is FOR here.** The visible flare at a light's own position is *already*
separate gamez geometry — C1's `docklight_flare` is a `Facade`/`SphericalY` mesh textured
`dock_liteflare.tif`, and the refinery's `flame01` is a `Facade`/`CylindricalY` mesh textured
`fire101.tif`. Both render without any animation. So `LIGHT_STATE` is not what draws the lamp;
it is the **spill onto surrounding geometry**, which is what the original's DX7 point lights
did to the same baked vertex lighting our world shader reads. Rendering notes in
`docs/architecture.md` under `WorldLights.cs`.

**Cost warning for anyone adding a handler here.** These events are not occasional. C1 fires
~2,700 `LIGHT_STATE`s per second at steady state, because each fire's flicker re-issues its
*full* event — `AT_NODE` included — every loop iteration. Resolving that node name per event
put ~1,740 calls/second through `AnimRuntime.ResolveOne`'s full-world fallback scan (7,064
nodes against a regex matcher, ~12M comparisons/second) and cost ~7 ms/frame on its own. The
name is what identifies the target, so the resolution is cached per light and only redone when
the name changes.

## `SOUND_NODE` is a three-event triple — the world's ambient audio

Implemented 2026-07-22 (`src/Mech3/WorldSounds.cs`). This is the waterfall roar, the train, the
firetruck and police sirens, the zeppelin nacelle engines, the fire crackle and the cockpit
warning beeper.

**`SOUND` and `SOUND_NODE` are different animals, and only one of them is ambient world audio.**
Surveyed across the whole install:

| | `SOUND_NODE` | `SOUND` |
|---|---|---|
| events | 1,244 | 6,091 |
| distinct names | **10** | 87 |
| all present in `sounds.json` | yes (10/10) | no (21 missing) |
| `3D` | 10/10 | 41/87 |
| `LOOPED` | 9/10 (`snd_freighter` is the exception) | 3/87 |
| activation | 951 `OnCall`, **293 `OnStartup`** | 4,378 `OnCall`, 1,650 `WeaponHit`, **8 `OnStartup`** |

So `SOUND_NODE` is a small, fully-resolvable set of looping positional emitters bound to nodes,
and `SOUND` is one-shot combat/destruction audio — gated behind the weapon hits and death
sequences M3 now produces, and 21 of its names are not plain `sounds.json` entries at all but
`DYNAMIC_WEIGHTS` groups (`air_mixed_exp_sg` picks one of five `snd_exp_hit*` at random) needing
their own decode. The ambient half landed first; the one-shot half **landed in M3 D31** —
`AnimRuntime.HandleSound` fires a fire-and-forget `WorldSounds.PlayOneShot` at the event's
AT_NODE, resolving a `SOUND_GROUPS` name through the decode now in
[sounds.md](sounds.md#soundsjson--the-sound_groups-block). The event's NAME is a sound
*definition* or a group, never a gamez node (the lone reader-scope one-shot names
`snd_waterfall`, a definition, and resolves zero node targets — see the C3 note in
`PLAN-anim-rendering-followups.md`).

**The reader spells one emitter as three consecutive events**, which is the whole shape of the
feature:

```
SOUND_NODE          ["NAME", ["snd_waterfall"]]                        -- declare the emitter
OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE ["NAME", ["snd_waterfall"], "STATE", ["ACTIVE"]]   -- switch it on
OBJECT_ADD_CHILD    ["PARENT_CHILD", ["waterfall01", "snd_waterfall"]] -- attach it to a world node
```

The middle event is an ordinary `OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE` whose NAME is a **sounds.json definition,
not a gamez node** — letting it fall through to the normal node resolution scans the world for
`snd_waterfall`, finds nothing, and books an unresolved op. The third is what positions the
emitter.

**The compiled form carries the same three facts inline** — `{name, active_state, translate}` —
but only sometimes: `translate` is an `AtNode` on **379** events and null on exactly **865**, and
865 is also exactly the number of `OBJECT_ADD_CHILD` events that attach a sound definition
(`snd_zepengine`→`spin` alone is 849). The two counts matching to the event is what proves
`SOUND_NODE` and the sound three-quarters of `OBJECT_ADD_CHILD` are **one mechanism**, which is
why they had to land together — and it is the concrete form of the dependency noted when
`OBJECT_ADD_CHILD` was withdrawn ("it is mostly the positioning layer for sound emitters, so it
should follow `SOUND`, not precede it").

Two field traps:

- **Compiled `active_state` is a JSON boolean**, where `PUFFER_STATE`'s identically-named field is
  numeric. Reading it with a number accessor returns null for `true`, and an absent-means-leave-
  alone default then leaves every emitter in the world switched off. That is exactly what it did
  until the headless log showed 38 correctly-placed emitters all reading "off".
- **The reader form carries no `active_state` at all** (its ACTIVE is the next event), so absent
  must mean "leave alone" and not `?? 0` = OFF — the same shape as the bug that silently killed
  the C1 waterfall's splash puffers.

**Reader-only coverage is dormant.** Of 252 reader `SOUND_NODE` definitions across the chapters,
231 have a compiled twin (compiled wins in `AnimProgram`), and all 21 that do not — `sprucegoose`/
`g_enginesound`, `locklear_gasbag`, the zep nacelles — are `ON_CALL`, which the bootstrap never
reaches. So the reader triple path is implemented and correct by construction but is not
exercised in a default session, the same status `NODE_UNDERCOVER` has.

**An emitter is silent while its host is not visible in tree**, the same rule the point lights
use: C1/IA1 deactivates both multiplayer zeppelins, so 36 of its 38 emitters are built and
stopped, and only the waterfall and the train sound. That is also what makes the counts safe —
C5 builds 108 emitters and plays none.

## The mission zrdr scope is a LIBRARY, not a manifest

A mission folder ships reader files it never uses. **A mission-scope reader definition applies
only if the mission's compiled `mis_anim` archive contains it** (matched on the compiled
extraction's own file naming, `<anchor>-<anim_name>.json`).

C1/IA1 carries a `zepstate.zrd.json` that hides `dliner1` and `cargotrain`, yet in the
original both are present in Instant Action — `dliner1` is the zeppelin inside the Passenger
Hangar (`dz1` is 140 m from it) and `cargotrain` is the consist parked in the cut below the
terminal at (-5102, 128, -3852). Its `mis_anim` compiles neither. Verified over every
zepstate in this install:

| Mission | zepstate defs | in compiled `mis_anim`? |
|---|---|---|
| C1/IA1, C1B/IA1, C1C/IA1, C2/IA1, C2B/IA1, C4/IA1 | `dliner1`, `cargotrain` | **unused** |
| C1/M02 | `hk_zep`, `lkshadow`, `tethershadow`, `tethertower` | COMPILED |
| C1/M04 | `dliner1`, `cargotrain` | COMPILED |
| C3/IA1, C3/M02, C3/M03, C4/M03 | `cargozep1` | COMPILED |

C3/IA1 compiles `cargozep1`, so this is **not** "Instant Action ignores zepstate" — the
compiled set is the authority. Two user observations of the original corroborate it: C1/M04
shows the field zeppelin with an empty hangar and no parked train (what compiling both defs
produces), and C1/M02 is the only mission where the tether tower disappears — the only
mission that compiles `tethertower`.

⚠ This **supersedes** the earlier note that `zepstate` "is never compiled into any archive",
which was generalised from C1/IA1. It is compiled into the missions that use it; being
uncompiled is exactly the signal that the mission does not instantiate it.

### Mission-spawned entities — SOLVED 2026-07-22, and not by a roster

Scenery props are hidden by compiled `zepstate` defs as above. *Entities* — the zeppelins,
the CTF props, the vehicles and guns — are governed by a different system entirely: the
**per-mission interp boot script** `support\<chapter>\<mission>.gw`, documented in
[interp.md](interp.md). They are present by default and the script switches them off, which
is the same polarity as `zepstate`, not the mirror image of it.

C1's `hk_zep` (the Hollywood Knights zeppelin, at (-5248, 200, -5208) beside `tethertower`)
has no def in IA1 scope at all, and needs none: `support\c1\ia1.gw` contains
`FindNode hk_zep` / `NodeSetActive off`, while `support\c1\m04.gw` does not — which is
exactly why it is on the field in M04 and nowhere else. The CTF props are switched off by
every mission script except `mp2.gw`.

⚠ **This corrects the roster hypothesis previously recorded here.** Neither candidate could
have gated anything, and both were checked before implementing:

- **`aiv.zrd.json`** is the AI *vehicle* table, not a spawn roster. Its only mention of
  `hk_zep` anywhere in the install is inside a wingman's target-priority list in C1/M02; C1/M04,
  the one mission that shows the zeppelin, does not name it at all.
- **`zeppelins.zrd.json`** is the flyable-zeppelin gameplay config (position/yaw/engines/
  cannons/gasbags). C1/IA1 lists `multiplayer1zep` — a node that mission's boot script
  switches *off* — and C1/M04 lists only `piratezep`.

The `dliner1` caveat that motivated the roster idea also dissolves: no name pattern is
involved, the script names its nodes outright.

## startanims.json

```
[["NEW_GAME_START", [["player_setup"], ["train_on_track"], …],
  "LOAD_GAME_START", null]]
```

Anim names (matched against `ANIMATION_NAME`) run at mission start, in list order —
order matters: C1/IA1 runs `hangar3_doors` (doors to ±50) then `mp_hangar3_open`
(same doors to ±25); last write wins. Names may be **undefined** in the mission's
visible scopes (C1/IA1 lists `pure_panic`, defined only in C1/M02's folder) — the
engine evidently tolerates the miss; skip and log.

## zepstate.json

Ordinary ANIMATION_DEFINITIONs, `ACTIVATION ON_STARTUP`, whose sequences hold only
`OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE`s — the per-mission roster of world objects present: C1/IA1
deactivates `dliner1` (the passenger zeppelin in the shed) and `cargotrain`. The
chapter gamez contains *every* mission's objects; without applying these states,
phantom zeppelins/trains render in every mission.

## `SAVE_LOG` / `PERSIST_LOG` are the cross-mission state log (decoded 2026-08-02)

A mission does not always start from `RESET_STATE`. The engine keeps a **state log** of
flagged definitions, and a mission load applies it on top of the bootstrap — which is how the
original shows scenery already destroyed in a mission where nothing could have destroyed it.

**User A/B in the original (C3, the `susp_bridge` suspension bridge — destroying it is an
`M01` objective, see `C3/M01/zrdr/objectives.zrd.json`):**

| sequence | result | what it shows |
|---|---|---|
| M01, destroy bridge → IA1 | destroyed | a campaign mission **writes** the log; IA **reads** it |
| → M01 again | whole | a campaign load **restores the baseline at the start of that mission** |
| → quit → IA1 | whole | IA applied the restored baseline |
| IA1, destroy something → quit → IA1 | reset | **IA never writes** to the log |
| alt+F4, restart, load M02 | bridge destroyed | the log **commits to the save** and M02's baseline includes M01's result |

So: **every mission load applies the log; only campaign missions write it; the commit survives
a process restart.** Note the last row is not authored into M02 — `support\c3\m02.gw` names no
bridge node at all, and the bridge appears in no `M02` reader.

**The flags are the per-definition opt-in.** `C3/zrdr/susp_bridge.zrd.json` opens
`NAME susp_bridge, SAVE_LOG ON, PERSIST_LOG ON, NETWORK_LOG ON, ANIMATION_NAME rope1burn,
ANIMATION_ROOT_NAME rope1, HEALTH 7`. Counted across all 1533 reader
`ANIMATION_DEFINITION`s in the install:

| | count |
|---|---|
| `SAVE_LOG` absent (default off) | 962 |
| `SAVE_LOG ON`, no `PERSIST_LOG` | 506 |
| `SAVE_LOG ON` **and** `PERSIST_LOG ON` | 62 |
| `SAVE_LOG OFF` | 3 |

`PERSIST_LOG` is a **strict subset** of `SAVE_LOG` — nothing persists without also being saved,
which is why the two read as a hierarchy rather than two independent switches. The three
`SAVE_LOG OFF` defs are pure cosmetic loops with no state worth recording (`hotelsign_loop`,
`refinery_fire_always`, `chuteman`).

**The 62 `PERSIST_LOG` defs are a curated list of fixed world scenery**, i.e. exactly the things
whose destruction a later mission should remember: `susp_bridge`, water/radio towers
(`ap_h2otwr`, `ap_radiotwr`, `ap_transmitter`, `col_tower#`), guard towers (`g_tower*`), the
generic building templates (`s_build**`, `m_build**`), boats and yachts (`leasure*`, `sailboat*`,
`yacht*`), grass huts, the Hollywood sign, `ramses`, the studio gates, trains (`train01/02`),
`mineshack`, `sluice`, `shaft`, `airdock2`, AA guns (`aagun**`, `maagun**`), army/fuel trucks,
and C1's fuel depot — `ftank0*` (`fuel_tanks.zrd.json`) plus `fuelbox*` for **both**
`fuelboxconnect*` and `fuelboxbreaks*` (`fueltruck.zrd.json`). The 506 save-only defs are the
transient layer: zeppelin turrets, gasbags, engine nacelles, balloons, player cockpit panels.

**Consequences worth keeping.**
- A mission's rendered world is `RESET_STATE` + `zepstate` + `startanims` + its `.gw` **+ the
  log**. Only the first four are recoverable from files; the fifth is session/save state, so a
  screenshot of the original is not by itself evidence about the shipped data (this is what
  `BL-099`'s C1 fuel depot turned out to be).
- Because `fuelboxconnect*` is itself a persisted def, a *running* pump animation is part of what
  carries — persisted state is not limited to a static destroyed/healthy flag.
- CSVM builds every session from the bootstrap and has no log, so it matches the original for
  campaign missions and for a cold instant action, and diverges only for an instant action loaded
  after a campaign mission in the same run (`BL-243`).

**Not yet pinned:** whether the commit happens at damage time or at mission completion (destroy,
abort without completing, restart, load the next mission), and a direct A/B separating the two
flags (destroy a `PERSIST_LOG` object and a save-only one in the same campaign mission, then load
an IA — the first should carry, the second should not).

## Scenario dimension (analyzed 2026-07-18 — negative)

Instant-action scenario names (`zeppelin_run`, `dogfight_ace`, …) appear **only** in
`ia.json` spawn lists (plus `disallow_missions`). No reader carries scenario-conditional
world state: the IA world state is per-mission (`zepstate` + `startanims`), identical
across scenarios; `zeppelins.json` is the gameplay config of the always-present IA
zeppelin (`multiplayer1zep`), not a state selector. Scenario selection evidently drives
spawns/objectives/AI at engine level, not the world build.

## Compiled anim archives — `cam_anim.zbd` / `mis_anim.zbd` (fork support COMPLETE, CLI wired)

The binary archives upstream mech3ax does not support for CS. Surveyed 2026-07-18 while
scoping the anim-playback engine (Run-2 item 9); since then the project's mech3ax fork
(`tools/mech3ax`, plan `docs/plans/PLAN-mech3ax-cs-revival.md`) has implemented them in
`crates/anim/src/cs/`: the container (item 3, 2026-07-20), the full semantic
`AnimDef` + event decode (item 4, 2026-07-21), and the SI-script frame decode (item 5,
2026-07-21) round-trip **byte-identically on all 61 archives of this install** with no
raw regions left except the per-axis spline coefficient blocks (kept as bytes by
upstream's own MW/PM convention; their semantics are decoded below). The CLI landed with
item 6 (2026-07-21): `unzbd cs anim <archive> <zip>` / `rezbd cs anim <zip> <archive>`
extract to the same zip-of-JSON shape as MW/PM/RC (per-def JSONs + per-script `*.zan.json`
+ `metadata.json`; the CS-only container data — the two base-file entries and the raw
runtime pointers `defs_ptr`/`scripts_ptr`/`world_ptr`/`unk40`/`zero_def_flags`, which vary
per archive and fit no PM-style mission table — ride in optional metadata fields).
Everything below is byte-verified against this install.

**Why they matter:** the vehicle motion (`OBJECT_MOTION_SI_SCRIPT`) references `.zan`
spline scripts that exist **nowhere as loose files** — they are compiled only into these
archives. Everything else about the anims (schema, sequences, timing, puffers) is already
in the zrdr readers; the `.zan` frame data is the *only* missing piece for the train.

- **Scope split (verified by strings):** a mission's `mis_anim.zbd` compiles only the defs
  its `mis_anim.json` lists (C1/IA1: the 8 zeppelin `ANIMATION_DEFINITION_FILE`s + its own
  file — no train, no vehicles). The **chapter's `cam_anim.zbd`** is not camera-only: it is
  the chapter-scope compiled anim archive, holding chapter + shared defs **including all
  vehicle SI scripts** (C1: the 4 train cars, 2 fueltrucks, mission-intro cameras,
  `cpilot_eject` body parts — 48 scripts total).
- **Container** (same family as MW3/PM `anim.zbd`, which mech3ax fully supports — **PM is
  the closest sibling**, verified 2026-07-20 against mech3ax's own structs): 16-byte header
  `{signature u32 = 0x08170616` (identical to MW3), `version u32 = 53` (RC 28 / MW 39 /
  PM 50), `nBase u32 = 2, nAnimFiles u32}` (byte order confirmed: C1 = `16 06 17 08 | 35 |
  02 | AA`); then nBase × `{path char[128], mtime u32}` (the gamez.zbd + planes.zbd the
  archive was built against — a CS-only list), then nAnimFiles × `{path char[80], mtime u32}`
  (the `.zrd`/`.zan` sources; mtimes are year-2000 Unix timestamps; entry shape = mech3ax's
  common `AnimDefFileC` exactly, though CS keeps the count in the header rather than before
  the entries). Then the anim-info block — **PM's 108-byte (0x6c) `AnimInfoC` layout
  verbatim**, decoded field-for-field on C1 cam_anim @0x38E0: `def_count u16` @10 (476),
  `defs_ptr` @12, `script_count u32` @16 (48 — the SI-script pool count), `scripts_ptr` @20,
  `msg_count/msgs_ptr` @24/28 (0), `world_ptr` @32, `gravity f32` @36 (−9.8), `unk40` @40
  (1), `one60` @60 (1), zeros elsewhere; the three pointers are per-archive runtime garbage
  (C1 cam_anim: defs 0x048F631C / scripts 0x048BB5DC / world 0x03B8000C — mech3ax's
  per-game `Mission` tables preserve these for byte-identical round-trip). Then `def_count`
  AnimDef records, then the SI-script pool, which runs byte-exactly to EOF.
- **AnimDef records (semantic decode COMPLETE 2026-07-21, fork plan item 4** — every field,
  support array and sequence event is decoded into mech3ax's API types in
  `crates/anim/src/cs/`; round-trip **byte-identical on all 61 archives**, and the decoded
  `hangar3_doors` matches its reader-JSON source field-for-field — activation, SAVE_LOG,
  all five RESET_STATE ops, all four sequences with their door motions**)**: each record is
  a **272-byte** C struct — PM's 268-byte `AnimDefC` layout with one extra dword — with the
  same field offsets as PM (`anim_name`[32]@0, `name`[32]@40, `anim_root_name`[32]@76,
  flags@156, status/activation/priority/`2`@160–163, exec range@164, `reset_time`@172,
  health@180, `seq_defs_ptr`@204, `reset_state_ptr`@208, `unknown_seq_ptr`@212, eight u8
  counts@216 (seq/object/node/light/puffer/dynamic-sound/static-sound/effect), prereq
  count/min@224, anim-ref count@226, then the support-array pointers). First record is the
  `reserved_anim_0` placeholder (carries its name, ON_CALL activation, INVALID anim ptrs,
  and a per-archive flags dword — C1/M05 has bit 21). After each record its support arrays
  follow inline **in this order**: NAME1 node path, objects, nodes, lights, puffers,
  dynamic sounds, static sounds, activation prereqs, anim refs, SI-script-id list; then an
  optional RESET_SEQUENCE, the counted sequences (64-byte PM `SeqDefInfoC` headers + `size`
  bytes of events), and an optional extra unnamed sequence when `unknown_seq_ptr`@212 ≠ 0.
  **CS deltas from PM** (all byte-verified): `execution_priority` ∈ {1,4,5,6} (PM always
  4); `anim_ptr`/`anim_root_ptr` @72/@108 hold real hash-like values (PM: 0xFFFFFFFF);
  `anim_name`/`anim_root_name` can carry truncation garbage past the terminator (preserved
  as pads); the **"unknowns" array is the compiled `NAME1` node path** — one 36-byte
  `{name[32], node ptr/index u32}` record per path component, e.g. `mp1zrprop11` carries
  {multiplayer1zep, reng11}, exactly `NAME1 ["mp1zrprop1*", ["multiplayer1zep","reng1*"]]`
  resolved for the instance; the **u32 index list** (count in PM's `zero227`@227, pointer
  in PM's `zero264`@264) is the def's **SI-script pool indices** — `freightercruise` → [0],
  `hooked_to_klondike` → [5..10], `cpeject1` → [14..28] — and the def's
  OBJECT_MOTION_SI_SCRIPT events index into it. Object refs are PM's 92-byte shape (node
  *indices* where PM stores pointers, and live `root_idx`); node refs PM's 44-byte shape
  with live `flags`/`root_idx`/`ptr`; a def's node list can contain **duplicate names**
  (same name, different pointers — the mech3ax fork disambiguates with a reversible `~N`
  suffix since events reference nodes by index); light/puffer/dynamic-sound 44 bytes;
  static-sound refs **40 bytes** = one garbage-padded name field (the garbage runs past
  byte 32); **activation prereqs (48 B) ARE used** (contra the earlier survey note): object
  prereqs carry `active` ∈ {0,1,2} and real pointers, `min_to_satisfy` up to the count;
  anim refs 72 B — `ref_ty` **1 = CALL_ANIMATION with LOCAL_NAME** (name + local_name
  halves, both garbage-padded), 0 = plain CALL_ANIMATION. Object/node name fields use MW/PM's
  `Default_node_name` padding convention, with zero-padded and garbage exceptions.
- **Events (all decoded):** the standard 12-byte header `{type u8, start_offset u8 ∈
  {1,2,3}, pad u16 = 0, size u32 incl. header, start_time f32}`. 35 event types occur in
  this install; **every type shared with PM has PM's exact payload layout** (e01 16 B, e02
  60, e04 140, e05 100, e06 8, e07 20, e08 16, e09 20, e10 320, e11 132, e13 12, e14 24,
  e15/e16 4, e17 8, e20 36, e22/e23 36, e24 68, e25 36, e26/e27 36, e28 68, e30 8,
  e31/e33 16, e32/e34 0, e35 4, e36 52, e41 24, e42 584). Three are CS-specific:
  **e12 OBJECT_MOTION_SI_SCRIPT is 64 bytes** `{0, node_index, script_index, 52 zero
  bytes}` where `script_index` indexes the def's script-id list; **e46 = SOUND_ADJUST**
  (176 B, the volume/frequency/pan fade-series op — `hdplayer*` defs; payload not yet
  field-decoded); **e47 = OBJECT_MOTION_SI_SCRIPT in its `ROOT`/`ALL_NAMES` form** (multi-
  node skeletal person animations — `caboosewave`, ladder climbs; payload = count u32 +
  count × 76-byte records, not yet field-decoded). **CS event quirks** (all preserved by
  the fork): `IF`/`ELSEIF` conditions add **NODE_BELOW_ALT 0x100** (node + altitude),
  **ANIM_HEALTH 0x800** (float), **ANIM_HEALTH two-value form 0x1000** (min/max — uses the
  dword PM asserts zero; `locklear_zep_nacelles` `ANIM_HEALTH [20, 32]`), and
  **NODE_ACTIVE 0x2000** (node index); `NODE_NEAR_GROUND` compiles to NODE_UNDERCOVER
  (0x10) **with the value negated**; node references know two sentinels — **INPUT_NODE =
  −200** (also in SOUND AT_NODE and PUFFER_STATE AT_NODE) and **MAIN_ROOT_NODE = −100**
  (both resolve to the def's anchor — `AnimRuntime.IsSelfNodeRef`; a `PUFFER_STATE` with
  `AT_NODE INPUT_NODE`, e.g. `large_30sec_fire`'s `fire_n_smoke`, thus emits on the effect's own
  relocated root, which is what puts a called destruction fire at the D32 call/hit site)
  (`OPERAND_NODE ["MAIN_ROOT_NODE"]`, and plain node refs); e27 INVALIDATE_ANIMATION
  carries index 0 or −100; e24 CALL_ANIMATION has stale small `wait_for` values without
  the flag; e10 OBJECT_MOTION adds flag bit 15 = **`GRAVITY [..., DO_INTERSECTIONS]`** and
  ranges compiled with only the MIN flag bit; e28 FOG_STATE carries real fog names
  (`drop_fog`); e04 light ranges can be negative/reversed; e42 puffer data has
  `START_AGE_RANGE` min −1, zero deviation distance with the flag set, size ranges with
  max == min, and the never-in-MW/PM `UNKNOWN_RANGE` flag live (incl. reversed values).
- **AnimDef flags (partially named):** bit 1 = EXECUTION_BY_RANGE (exact iff with the range
  fields); bit 4 = HAS_CALLBACKS; **bit 5 = "RESET_TIME key present in the reader source"**
  (oracle-confirmed: `hangar3_doors` has `RESET_TIME [-1.0]` and bit 5 set with value −1 —
  in CS the flag does NOT mean the value is ≠ −1); bits 10/11 = NETWORK_LOG SET/ON, bits
  12/13 = SAVE_LOG SET/ON (oracle-confirmed via `SAVE_LOG ON`); unknown CS-only bits: 2
  (prop/rotor spin defs), 14+15 (always together; `m_build`/`s_build` building templates),
  17 (rare; firetrucks/flak), 18 (nearly all defs), 21, 22 (nearly all defs), 23
  (camera/intro defs). The fork stores the raw dword (`flags_raw`) since the unknown bits
  make reconstruction impossible.
- **SI-script pool (fully decoded, fork plan item 5, 2026-07-21):** all 28-byte
  `SiScriptC` headers first (name pointers/lengths, `spline_interp`, `frame_count`,
  `script_data_len` — PM's format verbatim), then per script `{source path\0, object
  name\0, frames…}` with names exactly `strlen+1` (single nul, no garbage) and sizes
  declared exactly. `spline_interp` is a **real per-script bool** in CS (usually true;
  15 of the install's 1090 scripts carry false; PM: always false). Which scripts belong
  to which def is declared too: the def's u32 list (above) holds its pool indices, and
  each e12 event names its slot in that list. Frame = `{flags u32: 1=translate, 2=rotate,
  4=scale; start f32, end f32}` + one **76-byte block per set flag** (`flags=0` frames
  exist — 8,596 of 76,845 frames — and carry no blocks; this is what broke the 2026-07-18
  sentinel-guessing walker). Translate block (verified): `base Vec3` + 4 floats
  `(0, avgVel x,y,z)` + per-axis `{value, c1, c2, c3}` where `component(t) = value + c1·t
  + c2·t² + c3·t³`, `t` seconds since frame start, constant term = the base component
  (absolute) — verified exact against each next frame's base value and C1-continuous;
  the u32 at offset 12 is usually 0 but carries garbage in places (preserved). **Rotate
  block (decoded 2026-07-21):** `base quaternion (w,x,y,z)` + `delta Vec3` + the same
  three per-axis `{value, c1, c2, c3}` cubic blocks, but **relative and in half-angle
  radians**: the constant term is 0 (the cubics give each axis's half-angle offset from
  the frame's base), `delta` = the cubic's average rate over the frame
  (`f(dt)/dt`), and the rotation at time `t` composes **in the parent frame** as
  `q(t) = exp((fx,fy,fz)(t)) ⊗ base` (quaternion exponential of the half-angle vector,
  left-multiplied). Discriminated against right-multiplication and all Euler orders on
  every consecutive rotate-frame pair of the install: 53,515/60,411 pairs close the next
  frame's base to <1e-5 under L-exp (57,675 <1e-3); no competing hypothesis comes close.
  Residuals are compiler fit error on fast rotations (the M01/M02 ladder-climb scripts,
  ~1° over 60 ms frames) plus scripts with **uninitialized spline memory**
  (`pfighter11.zan`, C1/M04 — coefficients like 1.7e+27; its base quaternions still march
  smoothly, so bases are authoritative and splines only interpolate within a frame — and
  the reason spline blocks must stay raw bytes for round-trip, which is also upstream's
  own MW/PM choice). Scale block: translate's shape (rare — 477 frames set scale).
- **`spline_interp: false` means the spline blocks are GARBAGE, not merely unused
  (2026-07-22).** The uninitialized-memory quirk above is not a one-off: `pfighter11.zan`
  is simply one of the **15** `spline_interp: false` scripts, and *every* one of them
  carries junk in its coefficient blocks — leftover pointers, frame times, whatever the
  compiler's stack held. `piratezep.zan` (C1/M04) is the worst: its scale block's constant
  terms are `(0.0, 4.259e27, 4.611e27)`, i.e. a **singular** basis with one zero axis and
  two astronomical ones. Reading those bytes is not a slightly-wrong interpolation, it is a
  destroyed transform, and it propagates to every descendant's world pose.
  **A reader must branch on the flag**, and the non-spline form is plain linear motion from
  the fields that *are* initialised:

  | channel | `spline_interp: true` | `spline_interp: false` |
  |---|---|---|
  | translate / scale | cubic, constant term = `base` | `base + delta·dt` |
  | rotate | `exp(cubic(dt)) ⊗ base`, constant term 0 | `exp(delta·dt) ⊗ base` |

  Both rules were verified against the next frame's `base` over the whole non-spline set:
  translate/scale worst relative error **1.8e-4** (float32 rounding), rotate worst angular
  error **0.022°** over all 576 rotate frame pairs — versus **21.6°** if `delta` is ignored
  and the base simply held. So `delta` is a per-second rate in both, and the non-spline
  frame is *exactly the degenerate cubic* `(base, delta, 0, 0)` — which is how CSVM
  implements it, keeping one branch-free evaluator (`SiVectorChannel.Parse`).

  **The 15 are all one content family**, which is why this hid so long: the C1 `hkzep`
  zeppelin set (`hk_zep`, `lkgasbag01`–`05`, `lkztailgasbag`, `noserotate`, `zfronthalf`,
  `zbackhalf`), C1/M04's intro `piratezep` + `piratefighter`, and three C4 hookup cameras
  (`bhmhookup_cam1`/`cam2`, `cghookupcam1`). Nothing else in the install sets the flag
  false, so seven of eight chapters are completely unaffected by getting it wrong.
- **Validation state:** the fork's semantic decode round-trips **all 61 archives
  byte-identically** with every one of the install's **1090 scripts frame-decoded**
  (76,845 frames) — since item 6 also through the real CLI zip pipeline (test.py
  `--- ALL OK ---`, which additionally exercises the JSON layer). The 2026-07-18 survey's
  "24 of 48 C1 scripts fail to parse" was an artifact of not knowing the record delimiting
  (resolved by the headers + flags=0 frames); no camera/`cpilot_eject` frame-data variant
  exists. A second uninitialized-data quirk besides `pfighter11.zan` surfaced at the JSON
  layer (item 6): `carneypkup_cam.zan;camera1` (C5/M02) carries one degenerate frame
  (start=end=0) whose translate+rotate `delta` vectors are six `0xFFC00000` NaNs — the
  only non-finite decoded floats in the whole install (measured field-by-field). JSON
  cannot represent NaN, so the fork preserves the bits in an optional `delta_raw` field. Train data: 4 scripts
  (`tr_passengine1/tankercar1/boxcar1/caboose1.zan`) × 90 frames × ~3.64 s (= 40 ticks at
  `SCRIPT_FRAME_RATE` 11), total ~327 s per loop, starting at the parked consist position
  `(−6943…−6961, 128, −5456…−5412)` and covering a ~3.9 × 2.2 km track loop — all
  consistent with the C1 gamez node positions and the reader's frame rate.
- **What playback could already use without the binaries:** the C1 road vehicles
  (`cars_moving.json` `mafia_move1`/`police_chase`/`car_go_home_start`/`car_loop1_start`,
  `trucks_moving.json` `truck1_start` — all `ON_STARTUP`) move via `OBJECT_MOTION_FROM_TO`
  chains (`TRANSLATE_FROM/TO` + `ROTATE_FROM/TO` + `RUN_TIME` + `START_TIME` + `LOOP` +
  `CALL_SEQUENCE`/`STOP_SEQUENCE`) fully present in the extracted readers, as are the
  hangar-door motions; the train's steam `PUFFER_STATE` is fully inline in `train.json`
  (all emitter params + `smokestack` attach node). Firetrucks / fueltrucks / patrol boat
  are `ON_CALL` only (mission-event driven — nothing calls them in free flight).
## Consuming the extraction (playback, 2026-07-21)

Everything above is about *decoding* the archives. This section is what the Godot side needed
in order to **run** them (`docs/plans/PLAN-anim-playback.md`, revival-plan item 7) — four facts that
are not visible from the byte format alone, each measured against this install.

- **The two sources are complementary; neither is sufficient.** The compiled archives are the
  better data (typed events, resolved refs, the SI scripts), but a mission's `mis_anim.zbd`
  compiles only the defs its `mis_anim.json` lists — C1/IA1 is 160 defs, all of them the eight
  zeppelin files. **`zepstate` and `startanims` are never compiled into any archive**; they stay
  zrdr readers the engine loads at runtime. So a player has to merge both, preferring compiled
  on collision (keyed by anchor name + animation name, which is exactly how the extraction names
  its files: `<name>-<anim_name>.json`).
- **Reader op keys and compiled event tags are the same vocabulary under a spelling change.**
  SNAKE_CASE → PascalCase converts one to the other exactly, across the whole event set
  (`OBJECT_ACTIVE_STATE` → `ObjectActiveState`, `OBJECT_MOTION_SI_SCRIPT` →
  `ObjectMotionSiScript`, `FBFX_COLOR_FROM_TO` → `FbfxColorFromTo`, `IF`/`ELSEIF`/`ENDIF` →
  `If`/`Elseif`/`Endif`). Only the payload *field* names need per-kind mapping — and upstream
  spells the target field inconsistently per event type (`node` on ObjectActiveState/
  ObjectTranslateState, `name` on ObjectRotateState/ObjectMotionFromTo).
- **A support-array `ptr` IS the flat gamez node index — this is the correct binding.**
  Verified exactly: **136,048 references across all 8 chapters' `cam_anim` + every `mis_anim`
  resolve to a node whose name matches**, with the only apparent exceptions being the fork's own
  reversible `~N` duplicate-name suffixes (which the event names carry too, so lookups still
  hit). Events name their target as a *string*, which is ambiguous in the world — C1 has a
  `caboose` (the real consist, a child of the world root) and a `caboose.flt` (an unrelated rail-
  yard instance under a different parent), and name matching drives both, putting one of them
  somewhere wrong. A def's `objects`/`nodes` arrays are therefore its **symbol table**: resolve
  the event's name through them to get the exact index. Reader-sourced defs have no such table
  and keep the wildcard name matching (`ftank0*`, `s_build**`, `air_gen#`).
  ⚠ **Counter-example: the generic plane defs' indices are non-portable.** The compiled
  `player_crash_dirt` call closure references `piece1..4` at node indices 7703–7706 — out of
  range for the shipping planes gamez, because the def is generic across all 11 aircraft and no
  single plane's index space can satisfy it. The 136,048-reference verification above covers the
  world-scope `cam_anim`/`mis_anim` defs; a consumer binding plane-scope defs must resolve by
  NAME (and note a plane subtree staged into a world scene mixes two index spaces that collide —
  world index 400 and plane index 400 are different nodes).
- **Event scheduling, confirmed against `crimson.exe`:** each event's optional `start` is
  `{offset, time}` with `offset` ∈ `Animation` (since the animation started, gated against
  `anim+0xb0`) / `Sequence` (since this sequence started, gated against `seq+0x24`) / `Event`
  (since the **previous event completed**, gated against `seq+0x28`) — `FUN_004ecbb0` evaluates
  whichever origin is named exclusively against the event that carries the `start`. An absent
  `start` — 174,938 of the install's events — encodes as `Animation + 0.0` (mech3ax's `common.rs`
  collapses that pair to `None`), not `Event + 0`; it behaves as "as soon as the previous event
  finishes" only because the gate above is evaluated exclusively once the previous event has
  reported completion, regardless of which origin it names. The discriminating case is the C1
  train: each car's sequence is `[ObjectMotionSiScript, Loop{-1}]` with no start offsets, and only
  "after the previous event completes" turns that into the surveyed ~327 s track loop instead of a
  zero-length infinite loop. A definition's sequences run **concurrently**, confirmed the same
  way — the train drives its four cars from four sibling `Initial` sequences, each with its own
  script and its own loop.
  **`Animation` and `Sequence` are two different clocks, and the difference is reachable.**
  `anim+0xb0` belongs to the *definition instance* and is shared by all its sequences; `seq+0x24`
  belongs to the sequence and starts at zero whenever that sequence starts. They coincide only for
  a sequence the bootstrap starts with the instance — for one a later `CALL_SEQUENCE` starts, the
  animation clock is already running. Censused over the whole install
  (`analysis/anim-interpreter-decode/start_origin_census.py`): of the 3,934 events carrying an
  explicit `start`, **1,091 name `Animation`** — every one of them with a non-zero time, since the
  zero pair is what mech3ax collapses to `None` — and **191 of those sit in an `OnCall`
  sequence**, the reachable case (the other 900 are in `Initial` sequences, where the two clocks
  agree). The 191 are the rocket/torpedo/sonic trail puffers shutting off at `Animation 10.0`,
  `ap_light_seq`/`torp_light_seq`'s `LightAnimation` chains at `Animation 0.25`, `chuteman_drop`,
  `car_dust`, the `gen_flare_yellow` family's `light_loop`, and `generate_smokescreen`'s two
  emitters. CSVM resolves `Animation` against `AnimInstance.Clock` for exactly this reason.
  A present `start` gates **the event it is attached to**, not its successor — also confirmed —
  including the first event of a sequence, and including control-flow events (`LOOP`/`IF`), which
  take no run time and therefore do not advance the "previous event completed" base. The
  discriminating case is C1's bowl sign (`bowl`, gamez 4868, def `on_off`): nine strict on/off SWAP
  pairs where only the first event of each pair carries a timestamp — gating the *successor*
  instead shifts every sequence in the install by one slot (timestamped events fire a slot early,
  their unstamped partners a slot late, the sign spends 38% of frames blank), and a loop back-jump
  that resets the gate to zero discards the trailing `Loop {Event 1.2}`'s inter-cycle pause.
- **`LOOP` has two spellings of "infinite": `-1` and `0`, confirmed by mechanism.** `004ebfd0`
  maintains a **u16** counter that counts *up* and terminates when `counter == authored`, with `-1`
  special-cased infinite; `0` is infinite only as a consequence of that mechanism — a u16 starting
  at 0 cannot match an authored `0` until pass 65,536, not because the data merely happens to use it
  that way. `-1` is the common spelling; `0` is *not* "run zero more times". The install-wide count
  distribution corroborates the mechanism rather than standing in for it: across the compiled
  `cam_anim`/`mis_anim` of the whole install the count distribution is **`-1` × 2,919, `0` × 26,
  positive N × 530**, and all 26 zeros sit in 25 defs that are, without exception, **ground-vehicle
  route animations** — C1's `police_car`/`mafia`/`black_car1`/`truck1`/`car_loop1`/`car_go_home`,
  C2's ten `studebaker*`, C3/M02's nine `stude_move*`. Every one is `activation: OnStartup`, and in
  every one the `LOOP` is the **last event of its sequence**, over a body of `ObjectMotionFromTo`
  legs carrying explicit from/to (so a replay re-seats the car at the route start). Nothing that
  must terminate uses it: no door, gate, one-shot, hangar, bomb or explosion def carries `Count: 0`.
  Reading `0` as "stop" makes every car in the game drive its route once and freeze.
  **The reader (`zrdr`) scope never uses it** — 703 `LOOP` events there, `LOOP_COUNT` ∈ {`-1`
  (575), positive N}, zero zeros. (An earlier note claimed the reader scope has *no* `LOOP` events
  at all; it has 703. The usable fact is the absence of `0`, not the absence of `LOOP`.)
- **A positive `LOOP` count over an instantaneous body is a timer denominated in ANIMATION
  FRAMES, and the frame is 1/60 s — measured against the original 2026-08-02.** The
  *denomination* is forced: a loop whose body schedules no time can only advance one pass per
  engine update, so `LOOP n` spends n updates and the counts are durations, not iteration budgets.
  The update RATE was the open half until `CAP-19` closed it.
  **The measurement.** `ref_fueltanks`' `fire_n_smoke` (`[PUFFER_STATE, LOOP 200]` — from the
  *untimed* set, which is the only set that can answer this) burns ~3 s in the original, giving
  200/3 ≈ 60. That figure alone could not tell a fixed ~60 Hz sequence tick from one pass per
  *rendered* frame, since it was taken on modern hardware where the original visibly runs fast or
  slow between sessions. The same effect was then timed twice, at **60 fps fullscreen and 120 fps
  windowed**: the burn took **the same time in both**. Per-rendered-frame ticking would have halved
  it at 120. **The sequence tick is decoupled from rendering, and 1/60 is the original's own
  number** — every untimed count is a real authored duration.

  **Decode status: confirmed by mechanism, not by a rate constant** — `004ebfd0` returns state 4
  unconditionally after completing a loop pass, and the stepper (`FUN_004ecbb0`) treats state 4 as
  "re-gate from the top, then stop for this tick" (the handler state machine is in
  [`org/sequences.md`](../org/sequences.md)). That is
  exactly the coupling this fps-doubling measurement inferred from outside the process: one pass per
  engine update, never more, regardless of render rate. The `1/60` figure itself is a measurement,
  not a constant read from the exe; nothing in the decode pins the update rate to a cited address.
  ⚠ The one hypothesis those two points cannot exclude is a tick of `min(render rate, 60)` — capped
  at 60, coupled below it — because no rate below 60 could be provoked (and the run went through
  dgVoodoo). It changes nothing: CSVM paces against SIM time at a fixed 1/60, so there is no
  sub-60 rate to couple to, and the case would describe a period machine failing to keep up rather
  than authored intent.
  **Scope — the 530 positive counts are not one thing.** **462 carry no period of their own** and
  are the frames-denominated set (`LOOP 70` ≈ 1.2 s, `LOOP 200` ≈ 3.3 s at 1/60); 376 of them sit
  in `sequences`, the list the runtime executes, and 86 in the undecoded `unknown_seq`, which it
  does not. The other **68 carry a `START_TIME` on the `Loop` event itself — the per-iteration
  period in SECONDS** (`huge_fireball` 10 × 0.05 s, `sputter_fire_obj` 100 × 0.2 s, `shipsink`
  7 × 2.5 s). Their authored periods span 0.01–5.0 s, and **0.01 s is below a 1/60 frame** — so the
  timing layer is real-valued seconds, not tick-quantised, whatever the tick turns out to be.
  **That 68 counts only the FINITE ones.** Install-wide there are **599** timed loops; the other 531
  are infinite, and **126 of them carry a 0.02 s period** (`patrolboat`, `ptboat*`, `ftank_boom*`,
  `m_build0*`, `pass_plane0*`, `sub_destruction`, `balloont_die*`, `refinery_fire_always`,
  `refuel*`). 104 more carry `Sequence 1.0` and are the ground-vehicle routes.
  ⚠ **A remake must pace an untimed loop against SIM time, not its own frame rate**, or every
  authored timer scales with the client's hardware — at 240 Hz they run 4× fast and at 144 Hz they
  quantise to 48 Hz (3 render frames per 1/60 s pass). CSVM pins the pass rate to
  `SequenceRunner.AnimFrame`.
  ⚠ **A loop that carries its own period is NOT automatically safe** — this doc said so until
  `BL-237` (2026-08-02) measured otherwise. A period is only honoured if the rollover carries its
  overshoot instead of resetting the clock, and if "did this iteration schedule time?" is asked of
  the DATA rather than of `_due > _clock`, which becomes a question about the step as soon as the
  step is coarser than the period. Missing either, a 0.02 s period costs 2 steps at 60 Hz instead of
  1.2 (60% speed) and an absolute `Sequence 0.01` collects the untimed-loop frame floor (16.7 s for
  an authored 10 s). Both are fixed in `SequenceRunner`; the traps are why the seconds/frames split
  is not the whole story.
- **JSON-layer trap: the `.zan` rotate quaternion's field labels are shifted.** mech3ax reads the
  file's `(w, x, y, z)` float order straight into a `#[repr(C)] struct Quaternion {x, y, z, w}`,
  so in the emitted JSON **real `w` = json `x`, real `x` = json `y`, real `y` = json `z`, real
  `z` = json `w`**. Byte-identical round-trip is unaffected (the bytes never change meaning), so
  nothing on the mech3ax side reveals it. Verified on the C1 passenger engine: under that remap
  every base quaternion is unit-norm and the yaw tracks the frame-to-frame chord heading to ~1°
  (frame 1 quat-yaw −33.11° against a chord of −43.12°, spanned by the frame's own −0.0505 rad/s
  rate); read literally the values are not even normalised. Undo the shift at the parse boundary.
- **Compiled `PUFFER_STATE` payloads** (consumed 2026-07-21): the event carries the emitter's
  full parameter set inline, so no reader lookup is needed — cross-checked field-for-field
  against `train.json`'s own `steampuffer` (interval 0.03, LOCAL_VELOCITY 0/15/0, SIZE_RANGE
  0.8–1.5, LIFETIME_RANGE 0.5–4.5, friction 3, the five texture names, the three-stop colour
  ramp: all identical). Four shape facts: the emission interval is **always** in
  `interval_garbage.interval_value` (`interval` itself is null in all 4,387 PUFFER_STATE events
  of this install); the number in `interval_garbage.interval_value` is **seconds** for a Time
  emitter but **meters** for an `interval_type: "Distance"` trail (the crash-debris
  `spurtpuffer`s), and its flag shape is inverted — `has_interval_value` is **false** even when
  `interval_value` holds the real distance, so key off `interval_type`, never the flag;
  `GROWTH_FACTOR` arrives as a two-entry `growth_factors` array, which is an **`(age, scale)`
  ramp and not a min/max pair** — see the next bullet, which corrects what this one used to
  claim; and an event whose `textures` array is **empty** is an
  adjust/stop stub referencing a puffer another event defines — the readers have the same idiom
  (C1's `truck1dust_puffer` and `black_exhaust_puffer`). A `textures[]` entry's `run_time` is a
  **fraction of the sprite's lifetime**, not a second count — the survey that settles it, and what
  reading it as seconds did to `large_30sec_fire`, are in
  [effects.md](effects.md#puffer_state-schema). `at_node` is the attach point, and is
  NOT the event's `name` (that is the puffer's own name, a separate namespace). `ACTIVE_STATE`
  1 starts a continuous emitter and 0 stops it; definitions re-assert their puffers on every
  loop iteration, so a consumer must treat re-assertion as idempotent.
- **`unk_range` is `NEAR_FADE`** — identified 2026-08-10 (`PLAN-puffer-engine-deltas.md` item C7).
  The compiled `PufferState` payload carries the near camera-distance band under that placeholder
  name, immediately before `fade_range` (which is the reader's `FADE_RANGE`/`FAR_FADE`). Proven by
  matching both surfaces on one effect: C1's `black_smoke_ball_01-large_black_smokeball.json` has
  `unk_range {min: 70, max: 20}` and its reader block authors `NEAR_FADE [70, 20]`. ⚠ The `min`/
  `max` labels are the mech3ax field names, not a range: `min` is the hard discard cutoff and `max`
  the distance alpha would reach 1, so almost every event in the install has `max < min`. The
  semantics live in [effects.md](effects.md).
- **`growth_factors[i]` is `(age_i, scale_i)`, not `(min, max)`** — corrected 2026-08-09
  (`PLAN-puffer-engine-deltas.md` item B3, which closed as a disproof). This bullet previously
  read the entry as a size *range* and cited a "matches 172 of 177 puffers" survey; **both
  statements are withdrawn** — the reading was wrong and the survey does not reproduce (see the
  wildcard bullet below for what it was actually seeing).
  **The data alone proves the reading**, independent of the disassembly: **216 compiled events
  author a second entry whose "max" is *less* than its "min"** — `(1, 0.25)` ×71, `(1, −0.2)`
  ×39, `(1, 0.5)` ×26, `(1, 0.45)`/`(1, 0.2)`/`(1, 0.15)`/`(1, 0.0)` ×16 each, `(1, 0.1)`/
  `(1, 0.6)` ×8. `(1.0, −0.2)` (`fire_at_zepskin3`) is a coherent *stop at age 1, scale −0.2*
  and an incoherent *range*. **The parser agrees**: `crimson.exe`'s `PUFFER_STATE` reader
  `FUN_004f7120` accepts a `SCALE_SEQUENCE` key of up to six `(age, scale)` stops
  (`if (5 < i) break`), and when that key is absent falls through to `GROWTH_FACTOR` and
  **synthesises exactly the degenerate two-stop ramp `count = 2, (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, G)`**. So the
  compiled `growth_factors` array is not a growth *parameter* at all — it is `SCALE_SEQUENCE`,
  always, with `GROWTH_FACTOR` as its two-stop spelling. `FUN_0054e6e0` walks the stops with a
  per-particle cursor and **lerps** between the bracketing pair, clamping past the last stop.
  ⚠ **Do not "repair" a descending pair.** Under the old reading `(1, −0.2)` looks like corrupt
  data; it is a puffer that shrinks to nothing and then inverts, exactly as authored.
  **Reachability, measured over the whole install:** the literal `SCALE_SEQUENCE` appears in
  **0** of the 17,569 extracted JSON files — reader *and* compiled — and of the **4,535**
  compiled events carrying a `growth_factors` key, **2,906 author it and every single one has
  exactly two stops**, with entry 0 equal to `(0.0, 1.0)` in all 2,906 (29 distinct arrays;
  commonest `G` 3.0 ×666, 2.0 ×492, 2.5 ×279, 1.5 ×210, 8.5 ×160, 1.0 ×153). **A consumer that
  lerps `1 → G` over the particle's life is therefore correct for 100% of this install** and
  needs no ramp walk; the multi-stop machinery is real in the engine and unreachable in the data.
  Read the array as stops anyway — a single-entry synthesis of the form `[(0, G)]` encodes the
  *wrong* reading even where it happens to yield the right number.
- **A reader `PUFFER_STATE` `NAME` may itself carry a `*` wildcard, and it expands at compile
  time** (found 2026-08-09). The [name-wildcard convention](README.md#shared-conventions-zrdr-readers)
  is documented for scene-*node* references; the puffer name is a separate namespace (it is not
  `AT_NODE`), and it takes wildcards too. Three definitions in this install use one:
  `rc_smokn_stacks*` (`C1/M05/zrdr/redcross_ship.zrd.json`), `stack_puffer*`
  (`C4/zrdr/bhfchimney_smoke.zrd.json`) and `torch_puffer*` (`C5/zrdr/steam.zrd.json`). They are
  the whole explanation for the compiled surface's apparent orphans: of the **253** distinct
  compiled puffer names, exactly **7** have no reader definition — `rc_smokn_stacks1/2`,
  `stack_puffer0/1/2`, `torch_puffer1/2` — i.e. precisely those three patterns expanded, and
  nothing else. Conversely **9** reader names are never compiled: those same 3 patterns plus 6
  genuinely unused defs (`aa_car_puffer`, `fly01_puff`, `fly02_puff`, `fly03_puff`,
  `train_puffer2`, `zrapid01_puffer`). ⚠ **A reader→compiled name join that does not expand
  wildcards will report these 7 as unexplained mismatches** — which is what the withdrawn
  "172 of 177" survey above was doing.
  **Names genuinely collide across readers, separately from this.** Of the 879 reader
  `PUFFER_STATE` blocks (255 distinct names; 688 carry parameters, 191 are name+`ACTIVE_STATE`
  re-assertion stubs), **17 names carry more than one distinct `GROWTH_FACTOR`** —
  `trailpuffer1/2/3`, `spurtpuffer1/2`, `fire_n_smoke` (G ∈ {1.5, 2.5, 3.5}), `firepuffer`
  (5 values), `smokerpuff` (4.0 and 85.0), `smokepuffer`, `smokepuffer2`, `lgpuffer`,
  `blacksmokepuffer`, `whitehotpuffer`, `black_smoke`, `pandust`, `splasher`, `unit_fire`.
  Each is resolved per *file*, so a global name→definition table silently picks one at random.
  Compiled↔reader disagreements, once the wildcards are expanded and the per-file resolution
  respected: **none, on any key.**
- **Only `nodes` and `objects` carry node indices.** `lights`, `puffers` and `dynamic_sounds`
  hold runtime pointers instead — measured over C1/C2/C4/C5, **every one** of their 2,616 `ptr`
  values is outside the node-array range, while `nodes`/`objects` resolve 46,481/46,481 and
  31,323/31,323. Admitting the other three into a name→index table silently binds a puffer's
  own name to a bogus index.
- One plan-evidence correction: the `ANIMATION_PATH` key in `mis_anim.json` is the
  **directory** the engine resolves anim sources from (`..\data\c1\ia1\zrdr\zeps`), not a
  waypoint-motion primitive; no waypoint-path op exists in any C1 reader — path motion is
  SI scripts.

### The runtime decode lives in [`org/sequences.md`](../org/sequences.md)

Everything above this point in the section was inferred from the shipped data. The original's
interpreter has since been located and read directly out of `crimson.exe` with Ghidra, and each
paragraph above now states the mechanism the exe actually uses rather than the census that stood in
for it. Where the decode corrected a stated mechanism (the null-`start` encoding, `LOOP 0`), the
paragraph asserts the corrected one directly and keeps the census as corroborating measurement,
never as the sole justification.

**The decode itself is not repeated here.** It is one page,
[`docs/org/sequences.md`](../org/sequences.md): the function map and the live `SeqDefInfoC` offsets,
the handler state machine, the 47-slot opcode table, the three clocks, the LOOP and its remainder
carry, the depth-free IF scan, the condition flag word (fourteen kinds, of which this install
authors ten), `CALL_SEQUENCE`/`STOP_SEQUENCE`, `WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION`, `FBFX_COLOR_FROM_TO`, the four
shipped event kinds with no handler, and the list of places CSVM deliberately differs. This file
keeps the authored side: what the bytes mean and how the reader and compiled forms diverge.

# Multiplayer scoring and match end, decoded from `crimson.exe`

What a network match counts and how it stops. The placement side of the same match is
[`multiplayer-spawn.md`](multiplayer-spawn.md), and every message the match puts on the wire is
[`multiplayer-messages.md`](multiplayer-messages.md).

## One signed score per pilot

Every scoring event goes through `FUN_0046e1b0(pilotId, delta)`, which adds `delta` to the pilot
record's `+0x1c` and returns the new total. There is no separate kill counter in the match record:
the number the scoreboard ranks, and the number the kill target is compared against, is that one
signed running total, so a penalty moves a pilot **away** from winning.

The per-event amounts are config keys read by `FUN_004735b0`, each with a hard-coded fallback the
shipped data does not have to supply:

| Key | Global | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `score_suicide` | `0071c824` | **-1** (stored at `00473fc8`) |
| `score_kill` | `0071c850` | **+1** (stored at `00473ff2`) |
| `score_turret_kill` | `0071c7b0` | +1 |
| `score_zep` | `0071c808` | +100 |
| `score_zep_kill` | `0071d1d8` | +1 |
| `score_gas_kill` | `0071c84c` | +10 |
| `score_my_gas_kill` | `0071c7ec` | **-10** |
| `score_return_flag` | `0071c7fc` | +1 |
| `score_enemy_flag` | `0071c804` | +5 |

`FUN_0046ecd0` dispatches an event id to one of three per-mode tables on the mode field at
`+0x5c`. **Dogfight (modes 1 and 2) reaches `FUN_0046ed40`, which honours exactly three events**:
1 (`score_suicide`), 2 (`score_kill`) and 6 (`score_turret_kill`). The flag and zeppelin events
belong to the other two tables and cannot fire in a dogfight.

## Who the death is charged to

A death is reported by the dying pilot's own client, as message type `0x12` built by
`FUN_00498a90`, and handled by `FUN_00498bf0`. The packet carries a killer id at `+4` and a cause
at `+0xc`:

| Cause | Built when | Scored |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the killer argument is non-zero | `score_kill` to the killer, **or `score_suicide` to the killer** when killer and victim share the team slot at **remote record `+0x3c`**, the `0x1090`-byte record `FUN_00499d80` looks up, not the pilot record |
| 2 | no killer at all | `score_suicide` to the pilot who died |
| 3, 4 | a zeppelin part or a turret owner | that owner's event |

⚠ **There is no last-damager memory anywhere on this path.** The credited killer is the attacker of
the one damage event that took the hull to zero, read straight off the damage call's own argument
(`004ba1c6`…`004ba1de`, `killer = ((weapon[+0x10] == 0x10) - 1) & attacker`, so one damage class
reports as self-inflicted even though an attacker dealt it). The other reporter,
`FUN_0048b920`'s explode path, passes killer `0` unconditionally, and a one-shot latch at
`0071d1dd` means whichever fires first owns the death. So a pilot who is shot up, breaks off and
then flies into the ground scores a **suicide**, and the pilot who damaged them gets nothing.

## How a match ends

`FUN_004996d0(reason)` broadcasts the end (message `0x17`) and `FUN_00499730` turns the reason into
the end-screen line:

| Reason | Raised by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `00496e28`, the network tick, when the remaining-time query `FUN_0046c580` drops below 1.0 | the clock ran out |
| 2 | `00499343` / `004993ac`, inside the score broadcast, when a pilot's `+0x1c` reaches the target | somebody hit the score target |
| 3 | `0049afc7` | a mode-specific objective |
| 4 | `0049900f` / `004996a2`, after a death or a drop, when `FUN_004999f0` finds no two live pilots on different sides | nobody left to fight |

⚠ **A time-out has no overtime, no sudden death and no tiebreak.** Reason 1 sets the ended flag,
prints its line and runs the five-second wait at `0071c19c`; nothing computes a winner, and two
pilots tied at the top are simply tied on the board. The one thing that follows a time-out is the
end screen.

## The two limits are exclusive

`FUN_004136e0` reads the lobby's limit kind from `00642f94` and arms exactly one of them: kind 0
writes the time limit to `0071c180` and sets the score-limit-off byte `0071c1a2`; kind 1 writes the
score target to `0071c17c` and sets the time-limit-off byte `0071c1a1`. Each check is gated on the
other's byte, so the original never runs a match that can end either way. The remake's lobby arms
Time, Score or both as the host chooses, and with both the first one reached ends the match. That
is a remake decision and not a reading of this code.

## Limited Lives

**The lobby's boxes.** [Evidence: decoded] `MULTIPLAYERLOBBY_MISSION.SCRIPT`'s "Lives" heading
(ui 10100) holds the Limited Lives checkbox (10110), a two-character count box (overflow error
10521, so 0..99 by width) and the Auto Respawn checkbox (10111). The count box is enabled only
while Limited Lives is ticked. A host lobby opens with Limited Lives clear, the count box disabled
and empty, and Auto Respawn ticked. The script callback 5007 reaches handler `0x40dce3`, which
writes the count (`atoi`) to `0x642fac`, the Limited Lives byte to `0x642fa8` and Auto Respawn to
`0x642fb0`.

**The match's count.** [Evidence: decoded] `FUN_004136e0` (`0x41389a`..`0x4138c0`) writes
`limited ? [0x642fac] : 10000` to `0x71c18c`, and every pilot record's `+0x40` is seeded from it
(`0x495889`, `0x497aff`). Nothing clamps it. An empty box parses as 0, and a pilot on 0 goes to -1
at its first death and still counts as alive, which is a defect in the original.

**A death.** [Evidence: decoded] `FUN_00498bf0`, the `0x12` death handler, decrements the dying
pilot's `+0x40` on every peer (`0x498c41`). For the local pilot, and only while lives are below
100, it posts a five-second HUD line (`0x498c52`..`0x498cba`) in the `DAT_006eba60` colour, ahead of the
kill lines ([`multiplayer-messages.md`](multiplayer-messages.md) "The kill lines"): row 210 `MSG_NUM_LIVES` ("You Have
%1!d! Lives Left!") above one, row 211 `MSG_ONE_LIFE` at one, and row 209 `MSG_NO_LIVES` at zero.
No message carries a pilot's lives: each peer counts them from the death reports.

**Out of lives.** [Evidence: decoded] `FUN_00470a10`, the return step, gives a pilot on 0 no
respawn. It sets camera mode 0 (chase, `FUN_0042c280(..., 0)`), and `FUN_00493eb0` binds the
camera's `+0x150` to the next aircraft in the vehicle list whose out-of-flight byte `+0x91d` is
clear. [Evidence: weak negative] No removal from the roster or the scores was found.

**Reason 4.** [Evidence: decoded] After every death (`0x499004`) and every drop (`0x499696`),
`FUN_004999f0` looks for two pilots with lives on different team slots (`+0x3c`). With none it
calls `FUN_004996d0(4)`, whose end-screen line is row 135 `MSG_STATE_GAMEOVER` ("Game Over:") with
row 7067 `MSG_MP_ALL_ALONE` ("No Enemies Left"), through `FUN_00499730`'s jump table at
`0x499910`. A free-for-all therefore ends when one pilot with lives is left. It runs beside the
armed Time or Score limit, and the first to trigger ends the match. With unlimited lives only a
drop can raise it.

## Auto Respawn

[Evidence: decoded] With Auto Respawn set (`0x71c1a0`), `FUN_00470a10` respawns the pilot as soon
as the step runs. With it clear, the step registers `FUN_004709f0` for input command `0x13` Fire
Guns through `FUN_00537bf0(0x13, 0x4709f0)`. The press sets `0x71c1a3`, unregisters the handler and
re-enters the step, which respawns through `FUN_004969b0`. [Evidence: weak negative] The message
table has no "press fire to respawn" string.

[Evidence: undecoded] The step runs from mission-script CALLBACK code 12 (`FUN_0047e080`, the
multiplayer branch at `0x47e1ed`), authored in the `RESET_STATE` of `player-player` and the three
`player_crash_*` defs. The wait before it is therefore the crash def's `RESET_TIME`, which those
defs author as 0.0 and which [`anim-definitions.md`](../formats/anim-definitions.md) lists as
undecoded. The real delay is open.

## What the remake takes

`Flight/Modes/VersusMatch.cs` keeps the same signed score: `KillScore` (+1) per kill, `SuicideScore`
(-1) for a death with no killer, the kill-target row compared against the score rather than against
raw kills, and standings ranked by score with a tie at the top rendered as a draw. Kills and deaths
stay as separate display counters, which the original keeps in the pilot's career record rather
than in the match. The team-kill arm has no counterpart: the remake's Dogfight is free-for-all.

The lives rule follows the decode above, with three differences. The count is clamped to 1..99
(`DogfightLobby.ClampLives`), so the empty-box defect cannot launch. Ticking Limited Lives puts 3
in the box, the one invented number in the rule, since the original leaves it empty. A guest's
match counts deaths from the host's reliable score messages rather than from the death reports
themselves. Reason 4 is `VersusMatch.AllAlone`, checked after each death and each drop on the
host, which sends it as `NetMatchEnd.NobodyLeft`. An out-of-lives pilot stays on the scoreboard and
watches the next flying seat in chase view (`VersusMatch.NextWatched`). With Auto Respawn off the
crash camera runs its usual time and then waits for Fire Guns; R still respawns at any time. The
remake's crash camera time (3 s in a match) is not a reading of the original.

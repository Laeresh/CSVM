# The menu inventory: every in-scope screen, transition and asset

The authoritative census behind `PLAN-menu-presentations`: what
Built-in draws today, what the original's own data ships, which of the two answers each other, and
what neither answers yet. Part 1 is read out of `CSVM/src/UI`; part 2 out of the extracted UI
archive at `extracted/rof/` and the format decodes that already cover parts of it; part 4 names the
gaps as owed captures.

⚠ **A filename or a rectangle proves composition, not interaction.** Every row below says which of
the two its evidence carries. The original's campaign screens are the best-evidenced family in the
archive and that says nothing about the top level, the setup screen or the options pages, which is
the reading this page exists to prevent.

**Where the other halves live.** The archive container and the GUI script language are
[`formats/rof.md`](../formats/rof.md); the campaign scripts' behaviour is
[`formats/campaign-screens.md`](../formats/campaign-screens.md); the setup screen's option sets are
[`formats/instant-action.md`](../formats/instant-action.md); the briefing dialog is
[`formats/briefing.md`](../formats/briefing.md); the string table is
[`formats/strings.md`](../formats/strings.md). How the original's 800x600 space meets a modern
window is [`campaign-board.md`](campaign-board.md), which every screen here inherits. The hangar's
own callbacks and economy are [`hangar.md`](hangar.md), the mission-end book
[`debrief.md`](debrief.md). Built-in is `CSVM/src/UI/LaunchMenu.cs`, `HangarFlow.cs`,
`CampaignFlow.cs` and the `CampaignBoards`/`ComposedBoard`/`BoardFit` trio.

## Part 1: Built-in as it stands

### The three layouts

`LaunchMenu.Rebuild` chooses between three mutually exclusive surfaces, and every Built-in screen is
drawn by exactly one of them. This is the first thing the presentation boundary has to hold, because
the three take different input and different geometry.

| Surface | When | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Centred zones (`_zones`) | every screen that is not one of the two below | header / middle / footer bands, fixed band heights, one centred content column |
| Split panes (`_paneRoot`) | `Screen.Plane` with more than one joined player | one `SplitScreen.PaneRect` panel per player plus a shared bottom strip |
| Composed board (`_boardRoot`) | `Screen.Campaign` with a live flow | a `ComposedBoard` at authored 800x600 pixels through `BoardFit` |

### Screen census

`LaunchMenu.Screen` has 12 members. Two of them, `Hangar` and `Campaign`, are host states that
delegate to a flow rather than screens of their own, so the 12 contribute 10 player-visible screens.

| # | Built-in screen | Enum | Surface | Drawn from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mode | `Screen.Mode` | centred | `Modes` + the campaign and hangar door rows |
| 2 | Chapter | `Screen.Chapter` | centred | `Chapters`, filtered by `DangerZones` under Stunt Flying |
| 3 | Table of Contents | `Screen.Presets` | centred | `InstantActionPresets.All`, 19 rows in a 14-row window |
| 4 | Environment | `Screen.Environment` | centred | `Environments` (7) |
| 5 | Mission type + lives | `Screen.MissionType` | centred | `CurrentMissionTypes` (4, minus Stunt Flying where barred) |
| 6 | Waves | `Screen.Waves` | centred | four wave slots plus a Continue row |
| 7 | Wave editor | `Screen.WaveEdit` | centred | four fields over one slot |
| 8 | Wingmen | `Screen.Wingmen` | centred | count + aircraft |
| 9 | Wingman loadout | `Screen.WingmanLoadout` | centred | `FitRowsFor` over the wingman airframe |
| 10 | Aircraft select | `Screen.Plane` | centred or split | `_roster` plus the hangar door row for player 1 |
| 11-19 | the nine hangar screens | (`Screen.Hangar` host) | centred | `HangarFlow.Order` |
| 20-29 | the ten campaign screens | (`Screen.Campaign` host) | board | `CampaignFlow.Registry` |

`HangarScreen` (9, linear in `HangarFlow.Order`): PlaneSelection, Airframe, Engine, Armour, Guns,
Hardpoints, Paint, Name, Purchase.

`CampaignScreen` (10, a graph over a stack): Roster, Cabin, MementoSelection, PreviousMissions,
Briefing, FlightCheck, Ammo, PlaneSelection, Scrapbook, ScrapbookZoom.

### Launchscreen transitions

47 edges. Trigger names use the footer's own vocabulary: Accept is Enter / A, Back is Esc / B,
Loadout is L / Y, Presets is P / X.

| From | Trigger | To |
|---|---|---|
| Mode | Accept on Free Flight | Chapter, mode Free |
| Mode | Accept on Instant Action | Environment, mode Stunt |
| Mode | Accept on Dogfight | Chapter, mode Versus |
| Mode | Accept on the Campaign row | Campaign host, `CampaignScreen.Roster` |
| Mode | Accept on Build Custom Plane | Hangar host, `HangarScreen.PlaneSelection`, return Mode |
| Mode | Back | `Quit`, and the host leaves the game |
| Chapter | Accept | Plane (`PrimeJoins`) |
| Chapter | Back | Mode |
| Environment | Accept | MissionType; loads the environment's `ia.zrd.json` as `_iaBaseDef` |
| Environment | Presets | Table of Contents, cursor on the applied preset |
| Environment | Back | Mode |
| Table of Contents | Accept | applies the preset, returns to Environment |
| Table of Contents | Back | Environment, fields untouched |
| MissionType | Accept, Dogfight an Ace | Plane, skipping Waves and Wingmen |
| MissionType | Accept, any other type | Waves, cursor on the Continue row |
| MissionType | Back | Environment |
| Waves | Accept on a wave row | Wave editor |
| Waves | Accept on Continue | Wingmen |
| Waves | Back | MissionType |
| Wave editor | Accept | Waves (the fields were edited live) |
| Wave editor | Back | Waves |
| Wingmen | Accept | Plane (`PrimeJoins`) |
| Wingmen | Loadout, with wingmen | Wingman loadout |
| Wingmen | Back | Waves |
| Wingman loadout | Back or Loadout | Wingmen, fit kept |
| Plane | Accept, browsing | that seat locks its airframe |
| Plane | Accept, locked | that seat confirms; when every seat has, `FireLaunch` |
| Plane | Accept on the door row, player 1 | Hangar host, return Plane |
| Plane | Loadout, locked and unconfirmed | that pane's Ammo Selection list |
| Plane | Start on a free pad | that pad joins as a new seat |
| Plane | Back inside a pane's list | back to the airframe, fit kept |
| Plane | Back, confirmed | back to locked |
| Plane | Back, locked | back to browsing |
| Plane | Back, browsing, player 1, mode not Stunt | Chapter |
| Plane | Back, browsing, player 1, Dogfight an Ace | MissionType |
| Plane | Back, browsing, player 1, other Stunt types | Wingmen |
| Plane | Back, browsing, a guest | that seat unjoins |
| any screen but Plane | Back, a guest | that seat unjoins |
| Hangar host | flow `Exit` set, opened from Mode | Mode, roster refreshed |
| Hangar host | flow `Exit` set, opened from Plane | Plane, cursor on the built plane |
| Hangar host | flow `Exit` set, opened from Campaign | Campaign, flow resumed and profile re-read |
| Campaign host | `CampaignExit.Cancelled` | Mode |
| Campaign host | `CampaignExit.OpenHangar` | Hangar host over the profile's wallet, return Campaign |
| Campaign host | `CampaignExit.FlyMission` | `LaunchCampaign`; screen resets to Mode behind the session |
| (a session) | a board's Exit, when the run was menu-driven | `ShowLaunchMenu` → `ShowMenu(_spec.MenuStartScreen)` |
| (a session) | the build failed | the same, plus `ShowError` |
| (a campaign mission) | the mission ended | `OpenCampaignScrapbook` → Campaign host, `Scrapbook` |

⚠ **Every return from flight replays the CLI's own `--menu=` value.** `ShowLaunchMenu` passes
`_spec.MenuStartScreen` on every call, not only the first, so a run started with
`--menu=campaign-cabin` re-enters that aid on the way back rather than the Mode screen. E43 inherits
this: a semantic return destination has to beat the startup aid, or it cannot.

`LaunchMenu.OpenCampaignCabin` is the campaign's return door and `OpenInstantAction` the Instant
Action screen's: a mission or sortie left early comes back through one of them, while a mission that
ended goes through `OpenCampaignScrapbook` with the cabin behind the book.

### Hangar transitions

27 edges over `HangarFlow`. The order is linear, which is itself a divergence recorded in
[Where Built-in and the original disagree](#where-built-in-and-the-original-disagree).

| From | Trigger | To |
|---|---|---|
| any of the first 8 screens | Accept past the page's own handling | the next screen in `Order` (8 edges) |
| any of the last 8 screens | Back | the previous screen in `Order` (8 edges) |
| PlaneSelection | Back | `HangarExit.Cancelled`, the scratch plane dropped |
| PlaneSelection | Accept on New Plane | `StartNewPlane`, on to Airframe |
| PlaneSelection | Accept on a saved plane | `StartFromSaved` (a copy), on to Airframe |
| PlaneSelection | Accept on the trailing Delete / Sell row | the removal list |
| removal list | Accept on a plane row | `DeleteSaved`, list re-read |
| removal list | Accept on Cancel | back to the plane list |
| Airframe | Accept on a row that changes the airframe of an edited build | raises `DefaultsAsk` |
| Airframe | Accept on a row that changes the airframe of an unedited build | takes the default configuration unasked |
| defaults ask | Accept on Yes | loads the airframe's stock build, ask cleared |
| defaults ask | Accept on No | loads a bare airframe, ask cleared |
| defaults ask | Accept on Cancel | puts the airframe back, every other pick kept |
| Purchase | Accept, gate passed | `HangarExit.Built`, `CustomPlaneStore.Save` |
| Purchase | Accept, gate refused | stays, `Message` carries the refusal in the original's words |

### Campaign transitions

36 edges over `CampaignFlow`.

| From | Trigger | To |
|---|---|---|
| Roster | Accept on Continue, or on a roster row | Cabin, that profile seated |
| Roster | Accept on Cancel, or Back off the first screen | `CampaignExit.Cancelled` |
| Roster | Accept on Delete Player | the delete confirm |
| delete confirm | Accept on Delete | the profile is removed, back to Roster |
| delete confirm | Accept on Keep | back to Roster |
| Roster | Accept on the name row | arms the text field (`CapturesText`) |
| Cabin | Accept on Next Mission | Briefing |
| Cabin | Accept on Previous Missions | PreviousMissions |
| Cabin | Accept on Plane Construction | `CampaignExit.OpenHangar` |
| Cabin | Accept on Return to Main Menu, or Back | `CampaignExit.Cancelled` |
| PreviousMissions | Accept on a mission row | Scrapbook at that mission's spread 1 |
| PreviousMissions | Accept on the current-mission tab | Scrapbook at the campaign's own position |
| PreviousMissions | Accept with an empty list | Scrapbook at slot 0 |
| PreviousMissions | Accept on Replay Mission | Briefing |
| PreviousMissions | Back, or Return to Cabin | Cabin |
| Briefing | Accept on Go To Flight Check | FlightCheck |
| Briefing | Back, or Return to Cabin | Cabin |
| FlightCheck | Accept on Change Ammo | Ammo, for that crew slot |
| FlightCheck | Accept on Change Plane | PlaneSelection, for that crew slot |
| FlightCheck | Accept on Return To Briefing, or Back | Briefing |
| FlightCheck | Accept on Fly Mission, guests still to fill in | the next guest's own page of the same screen |
| FlightCheck | Accept on Fly Mission, field complete | `CampaignExit.FlyMission` |
| Ammo | Accept on a combo row | opens that drop-down |
| Ammo | Accept inside an open combo | commits the pick, closes it |
| Ammo | Accept on Accept Loadout | FlightCheck, working copy committed |
| Ammo | Accept on Cancel Loadout, or Back | FlightCheck, working copy dropped |
| PlaneSelection | Accept on a combo row | opens that drop-down |
| PlaneSelection | Accept inside an open combo | commits the pick, closes it |
| PlaneSelection | Accept on Accept Selections | FlightCheck |
| PlaneSelection | Accept on Cancel Selections, or Back | FlightCheck |
| Scrapbook | Accept on a scrap | ScrapbookZoom on that scrap |
| Scrapbook | Accept on View All Missions | PreviousMissions |
| Scrapbook | Accept on the back tab at the front of the book | PreviousMissions |
| Scrapbook | Accept on Replay Mission | Briefing |
| Scrapbook | Accept on Return To Cabin, or Back | Cabin |
| ScrapbookZoom | Accept on Continue, or Back | Scrapbook |

### Sub-states and modals

Nine states a screen can be in that are not screen enum members. Each is a separate presentation
problem, and none of them is visible to a census of the three enums.

| # | State | Owner | What changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | split-pane aircraft select | `LaunchMenu` | one panel per joined player instead of the centred column |
| 2 | a pane's Ammo Selection list | `PlayerSeat.InLoadout` (the shared player setup) | that seat reads nothing else, and nobody can launch while one is open |
| 3 | the hangar's defaults ask | `HangarFlow.DefaultsAsk` | the Airframe screen becomes a three-row question |
| 4 | the hangar's removal list | `HangarPlaneSelectionPage._removing` | the plane list becomes a Delete / Sell list plus Cancel |
| 5 | the roster's delete confirm | `CampaignRosterPage._confirming` | the whole screen becomes two rows |
| 6 | an armed name field | `CampaignFlow.CapturesText` | the keyboard types and the cursor axes come from the pad alone |
| 7 | an open drop-down | `CampaignFlow.OpenCombo` | ⚠ only while its own row is focused; a page that leaves one open behind a moved cursor strands it |
| 8 | a guest's flight check | `CampaignFlightField` | the same screen, driven by that guest's own device |
| 9 | the error line | `LaunchMenu._error` | a refusal from either flow's gate rides the focused screen |

### The `--menu=` aid map

The parser accepts **32** values; `docs/cli.md` documents **31**. `name` (the hangar's PLANENAME
screen, reached through `OpenHangarAid`) is accepted and undocumented, which is a `cli.md` edit
outside this item's fence.

Every accepted value appears exactly once below. Eleven of the 12 `LaunchMenu.Screen` members are
named in it; `WaveEdit` is the twelfth and has no aid, which is the warning under the table.

| `--menu=` value | Opens | Screen enum |
|---|---|---|
| (absent), `mode` | the Mode screen | `Mode` |
| `chapter` | the chapter pick | `Chapter` |
| `presets` | the Table of Contents | `Presets` |
| `environment` | wizard step 1 | `Environment` |
| `missiontype` | wizard step 2 | `MissionType` |
| `waves` | wizard step 3, cursor on Continue | `Waves` |
| `wingmen` | wizard step 4 | `Wingmen` |
| `wingmanloadout` | the flight's one fit, arming two wingmen if none are set | `WingmanLoadout` |
| `plane` | aircraft select, browsing | `Plane` |
| `selected` | aircraft select, player 1's airframe locked | `Plane` |
| `loadout` | player 1's Ammo Selection list | `Plane` |
| `hangar` | the hangar's plane list | `Hangar` |
| `airframe` | the hangar's airframe list | `Hangar` |
| `defaults` | the airframe list mid-ask | `Hangar` |
| `name` | the hangar's PLANENAME screen (**undocumented**) | `Hangar` |
| `paint` | the hangar's paint screen | `Hangar` |
| `campaign` | the real profile roster | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-empty` | the roster with no profiles | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-roster` | the roster with two profiles | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-entry` | the roster with a name being typed | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-cabin` | the cabin | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-previous` | the previous-missions list | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-scrapbook` | the book at the last mission flown | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-briefing[:seconds]` | the briefing, reveal advanced | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-flightcheck` | the flight check | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-guestcheck[:player]` | a guest's own flight check | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-ammo` | ammo selection | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-planeselection[:export]` | plane selection, or its export messagebox | `Campaign` |
| `campaign-hangar` | the hangar over the profile's wallet | `Campaign` → `Hangar` |
| `campaign-fly` | walks a real profile to Fly Mission and launches | `Campaign` |
| `loadboard[:mission_type]` | the load screen's blackboard, over the menu, writing that mission type's own dialog | out of scope |
| `loadboard-campaign[:CM]` | the load screen's chart sheet for that campaign mission, `CM01` by default, over the menu; it reads the memento off a `--campaign=` profile the same way | out of scope |
| `pauseboard[:CM[:done]]` | the Original presentation's pause sheet for that campaign mission, `CM01` by default, with that many of its objectives marked. A `--campaign=<profile>:<seq>` beside it hangs that profile's own memento, the way a real pause does; without one the sheet hangs the seeded pin-up | out of scope |
| `pauseboard-ia[:chapter[:mission_type]]` | the Original presentation's Instant Action pause blackboard for that chapter's environment and mission type, `C1` and `stunt_flying` by default | out of scope |

⚠ **`Screen.WaveEdit` has no aid.** It is the only screen enum member with no `--menu=` value, so
the wave editor is the one Built-in screen that cannot be screenshot without a hand at the controls.
B11 and C21 need one before they can pin it.

⚠ **No aid can open a drop-down.** The `:<n>` argument spends itself on `flow.Move(1)`, so the two
open-combo states above are unreachable from the CLI; this is `BL-659` and it blocks D32's
pixel comparison of the ammo and plane-selection screens in their open state.

## Part 2: the original as the data ships it

### What the shell is made of

`crimson.rof` ships **61 GUI scripts** in `ASSETS/SCRIPTS/`. Five are infrastructure:
`SCRIPTLOADER` (the entry point, which runs the other four), `CTL` (the `LAYOUT.CSV`-driven widget
class library), `CC` (a second, independent widget library), `SHAREDITEMS` (list-row renderers) and
`GLOBALS` (cursors, sounds, the 3D font, the splash music). The remaining **56 are screens**: 34
single-player and 22 multiplayer.

`LAYOUT.CSV` carries **35 sections** (`[GLOBALVARS]` plus one `[@ScriptName@]` per screen), and
those 34 screen sections are exactly the 34 single-player scripts, one to one. **The 22 multiplayer
scripts have no layout section at all**: they use the `CC` library and assign geometry inline, so
decoding `LAYOUT.CSV` reaches 34 of the 56 screens and no part of multiplayer. Do not read the
archive's 61 scripts as 61 decodable screens.

A screen is three files acting together, which
[`formats/campaign-screens.md`](../formats/campaign-screens.md) established and which holds for
every section here: the layout row declares the widget, the script creates and drives it, and
`crimson.exe` answers the callbacks. Roughly half the navigation is in the layout rather than the
script (see below), so a reimplementation reading only the scripts finds those buttons inert.

### `LAYOUT.CSV`'s own shape

56,148 bytes, 1,222 lines, ASCII, CRLF. There is no header row: the file is an INI-like sectioned
key/value file whose values are comma-separated positional records, and lines 1 to 41 are a
self-documenting comment block declaring one field list per widget type. The four line kinds are a
comment (`;`), a section header (`[NAME]`, indented cosmetically to show the designers' hierarchy),
a macro definition (`G<n>=NAME,VALUE` file-wide in `[GLOBALVARS]`, `V<n>=NAME,VALUE` per section),
and a widget row (`KEY=<type>,field,field,…`, the key optionally tab-padded before the `=`).

**636 widget rows in 10 types.** The comment block documents eleven; `W` (sound object) is declared
and never used, so the shipped file authors no audio at all.

| Type | Widget | Rows | Script class |
|---|---|---|---|
| `T` | text | 297 | `PE` |
| `B` | button | 119 | `BE` |
| `P` | pane | 106 | `ZJ` |
| `D` | dropdown | 70 | `PM` |
| `A` | text list | 16 | `SJ` |
| `S` | scrolling text | 8 | `JN` |
| `M` | movie | 6 | `AL` |
| `L` | listbox | 6 | `EN` |
| `E` | edit box | 4 | `IM` |
| `Z` | slider | 4 | `DL` |
| `W` | sound object | 0 | `SK` |

⚠ **The comment block's declared field lists do not reproduce the shipped rows, for any type.**
No shipped row carries `HelpID`, `TabOrder`, `ScriptPointer` or `Group`; removing those four from
the declared lists reproduces every row's field count in the file. The visible case is `B`, where
`ResID` and `ScriptToExe` end up adjacent at indices 5 and 6
(`MM_B_CAMPAIGN=B,MM_B_Campaign.png,279,282,0,0,Campaign,0x1000,0,…`). The established per-type
orders are in [`formats/menu-layout.md`](../formats/menu-layout.md); this page does not restate
them.

⚠ **Two substitution mechanisms, easily confused.** `<NAME>` is textual macro substitution,
resolved against the section's own `V<n>` rows first and `[GLOBALVARS]`' `G<n>` rows second; it can
expand to a number, an ARGB colour or a filename. `[@ScriptName@]` is a section header only and
never appears inline. Cross-screen navigation uses the bare script name in the button's
`ScriptToExe` field, not a bracketed macro. **Every macro token the shipped file uses resolves**,
including the five [`campaign-board.md`](campaign-board.md) measured off screenshots as unresolved.

⚠ **A widget key a script creates need not have a layout row.** `MAINMENU.SCRIPT` creates
`mm_t_title` and fills it from `uiData` 2152, and `[@MainMenu@]` has no `MM_T_TITLE` row: the text
exists with no authored geometry. A decoder keyed on `LAYOUT.CSV` alone will not know the widget is
there, let alone where to put it.

The two other authored files are `SCRAPBOOK.CSV` (35,154 bytes, one `[SCRAPBOOK]` section keyed
`<mission>_<spread>_<item>`, with a quoted comma-bearing field `"Left,Top,Right,Bottom"` a parser
must handle) and `ASSETS/SCRIPTS/RESOURCE.H`, the `IDS_*` symbol to numeric id map that joins a
layout row to the string table.

### The navigation graph the layout states

**46 edges** carry a `ScriptToExe` name. This is the half of the navigation the scripts are silent
about, and it is machine-readable as it stands.

| From | Control | To |
|---|---|---|
| MainMenu | `MM_B_CAMPAIGN` | Campaign |
| MainMenu | `MM_B_INSTANTACTION` | InstantAction |
| MainMenu | `MM_B_MULTIPLAYER` | MultiPlayerMain |
| MainMenu | `MM_B_PREFERENCES` | Preferences |
| MainMenu | `MM_B_CREDITS` | Credits |
| Preferences | `PF_B_GAMEOPTIONS` / `PF_B_AUDIO` / `PF_B_VIDEO` / `PF_B_CONTROLS` | GameOptions / Audio / Video / ControlsPrefs (all four live) |
| GameOptions, Audio, Video, ControlsPrefs | `*_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` / `*_B_CANCELCHANGES` | Preferences (8 edges) |
| ControlsPrefs | `CP_B_KEYS` | Keys |
| Keys | `KB_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` / `KB_B_CANCELCHANGES` | ControlsPrefs |
| PassengerCabin | `PC_B_CHANGEMOMENTO` | MomentoSelection |
| PassengerCabin | `PC_B_PREVIOUS` | ScrapBook_TOC |
| PassengerCabin | `PC_B_PLANEX` | **PlaneName** |
| PassengerCabin | `PC_B_RETURNMM` | MainMenu |
| MomentoSelection | `MS_B_ACCEPT` / `MS_B_CANCEL` | PassengerCabin |
| FlightCheck | `FC_B_CHANGEPLANE` / `FC_B_CHANGEPLANEW` | PlaneSelection |
| FlightCheck | `FC_B_CHANGEAMMO` / `FC_B_CHANGEAMMOW` | OrdinanceLayout |
| PlaneSelection | `PS_B_ACCEPT` / `PS_B_CANCEL` | FlightCheck |
| OrdinanceLayout | `OL_B_ACCEPT` / `OL_B_CANCEL` | FlightCheck |
| PlaneConstruction | `PX_B_AIRFRAME` / `_ENGINE` / `_ARMOR` / `_GUNS` / `_HARDPOINTS` / `_PAINT` | the six build screens |
| PlaneConstruction | `PX_B_Ready` | Purchase |
| ScrapBook_TOC | `SBTOC_B_RETURN` | PassengerCabin |
| ScrapBook | `SB_B_RETURNPC` | PassengerCabin |
| InstantAction | `IA_B_Exit` | MainMenu |
| IA_WrapUp | `IAWU_B_CONTINUE` | InstantAction |
| Credits | `CR_B_Exit` | MainMenu |

⚠ **The cabin's PLANE CONSTRUCTION goes to `PlaneName`, not `PlaneConstruction`.** The name comes
first in the original's own chain.

⚠ **`PX_B_*` is a tab bar, not a sequence.** The six build screens hang off `PlaneConstruction` as
siblings, each reachable from it directly; there is no next-screen edge between Airframe and Engine
in the data. Built-in walks them linearly, which is a divergence, not a decode.

### Coverage

`CSVM.Tests/OriginalCoverageTests.cs` is the machine check of this page against the Original
presentation: it drives `OriginalShell` from the top level to every screen and back by three input
families (pointer clicks on the rows' rectangles, keyboard cursor commands walking down and right,
pad cursor commands walking up and left), once over the hand-authored fixture layout and once over
the install's own `menu_layout.json` and art. Every `ScriptToExe` edge of an in-scope section must
have an entry saying how Original realises it, and the entry is checked against the shell. The
tally over the install: 32 screens (every `OriginalScreen`) reached and left with no open campaign,
build or dialog behind; 55 journeys by 3 families; 46 edges of which **42 are driven** (the row is
pressed and the target screen shows), **2 are realised as the wingman slot's row** (`FC_B_CHANGEPLANEW`
and `FC_B_CHANGEAMMOW` are the pilot's plaques at the wingman's slot, present exactly when the
mission flies a wingman), **1 is drawn disabled** (`MM_B_MULTIPLAYER`) and **1 is out of scope**
(`IAWU_B_CONTINUE`); 0 dead ends. The exits are checked too: Quit as a `QuitExit`, ACCEPT CHANGES as a
`OptionsApplyExit`, FLY on Free Flight and Fly Mission on Instant Action as a `LaunchExit`,
FLY MISSION as a `CampaignMissionExit`, and Purchase Now returning to the top level with the plane
saved. Keyboard and pad share one semantic command vocabulary at the seat seam (Decision 25), so
the two cursor families differ in the walk they take, not in the commands the shell sees; the
device mapping behind them is the seats' own tests.

### In scope and out of scope

Decision 5 puts everything `LaunchMenu` hosts in scope. Mapping that onto the original's 34
single-player screens leaves **29 in and 5 out**, before the 22 multiplayer screens, which are all
out (CSVM's Dogfight is splitscreen on `dogfight_ace` spawns, not the original's network play).

**In scope (29):** MainMenu; Preferences, GameOptions, Audio, Video, ControlsPrefs, Keys; Credits;
InstantAction; Campaign, PassengerCabin, MomentoSelection, FlightCheck, PlaneSelection,
OrdinanceLayout, ScrapBook, ScrapBook_TOC, ScrapbookZoom; Hangar, PlaneName, PlaneConstruction,
AirFrame, Engine, Armor, Guns, HardPoints, Paint, Purchase; MessageBox.

**Out of scope (5):** CampaignIntro and FinalCinema (MPG playback, `BL-446`); Save and Load (no
savegame system here, and the `LOAD` branch is unreachable in the shipped build);
IA_WrapUp (a flight board, excluded by Decision 5).

All five Preferences leaves are built. GameOptions, Audio and Video carry the shared options: the
difficulty and the presentation stand on the first, the four volume levels on the second, the
graphics mode, the display mode and the V-Sync choice on the third. ControlsPrefs and Keys stand
over the shared `ControlsFeature`, so all four page doors (`PF_B_GAMEOPTIONS`, `PF_B_AUDIO`,
`PF_B_VIDEO`, `PF_B_CONTROLS`) are live.
Multiplayer is network play with no local counterpart, so `MM_B_MULTIPLAYER` draws its disabled
frame and takes no input. `MM_B_CREDITS` is live and opens the credits screen, which is built
whole: the pane, both buttons, the About box and the right-button line.

### Screen by screen

Composition means an authored rectangle, art name or string id. Interaction means a decoded
behaviour: what a press does, what a rollover changes, what is disabled when.

| Original screen | Built-in counterpart | Layout | Script decoded | Capture | Interaction evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MainMenu | Mode | 9 rows | this page | **none** | composition only; script text gives the six buttons and their targets, nothing about rollover, music or the flag movie. **Built as Original's top level** from the two panes and the six `B` rows with their four-frame strips: Campaign, Instant Action, Preferences (the Options screen), Credits and Quit react, Multiplayer draws the disabled frame and takes no input, and the movie's place is black. Quit terminates on the press with no confirm, which is `MAINMENU.SCRIPT`'s own `terminate` on `mm_b_quit` |
| (none: remake-only) | Free Flight, Chapter, Plane | none | none | none | **Original's Free Flight door and screen, of our design under Decision 11.** The door is a text button in the `FC_B_CHANGEPLANE` paper-plaque convention beside the button frame, level with Campaign; the screen is the logo over two text lists (the shared chapter roster and the shared aircraft roster, the eleven stock airframes then the saved custom planes in an eleven-row window) with BACK and FLY plaques and a seat strip under the chapters. Seat 0 alone picks here; each joined seat picks on the per-seat aircraft screen below. Nothing on it is decoded |
| (none: remake-only) | Dogfight, Chapter, Plane | none | none | none | **Original's Dogfight door and screen, of our design under Decision 11.** The door sits under the Free Flight door in the same plaque convention; the screen is the Free Flight screen's shape over the Dogfight gate (a second seat must join and confirm before FLY stands). The original's Multiplayer is network play and ships no split-screen Dogfight, so nothing here is decoded |
| (none: remake-only) | the join strip and per-seat picks | none | none | none | **Original's join flow, of our design.** Start on an unclaimed pad joins a seat on either sortie screen, the Instant Action screen or the campaign flight check (the same gesture and pad bookkeeping as Built-in's, through `MenuSeatDevices`); seat 0's mouse, keyboard or pad picks the map and the aircraft and presses FLY, which is its own confirmation; with another pilot joined the per-seat walk's last confirm takes that press, so the sortie launches there rather than back on the sortie screen. On the campaign the walk is the flight check itself, one player's check at a time: that pilot's own device drives their check and the ammo and plane screens it opens, plus the mouse riding seat 0's source, and nothing else of seat 0's. The original has no join gesture |
| (none: remake-only) | the per-seat aircraft screen | none | none | none | **Original's per-seat aircraft screen, of our design.** Once seat 0 has picked, each joined seat in player order picks on a screen of its own, the campaign plane-selection board's shape (`PS_BACKGROUND` and its section's slots) over the sortie or Pilot Plane roster: the list field, the silhouette, the ratings and weapon column, WEAPON LOADOUT over a selection (borrowing the pilot block's `PS_B_EXPORTP` geometry, which the remake's picker draws no EXPORT in), ACCEPT and CANCEL SELECTIONS. Accept selects, a second Accept confirms, and the last seat's confirm is the launch, the screen the walk came from returning instead where FLY's own gate is unmet. WEAPON LOADOUT opens the `[@OrdinanceLayout@]` chrome on that seat's own fit and returns to the picker, so each pilot's weapons ride their own seat into the launch. Back and CANCEL SELECTIONS each take back a selection and over the open list each leaves the walk with every seat kept, nothing here unjoins, and joining stays closed while it shows. Only the picking seat's own device drives it, plus the mouse, which rides seat 0's source; nothing else of seat 0's reaches the screen. The original has no such screen and nothing on it is decoded; only the board's chrome is |
| Preferences (as Options) | Options | 14 rows | this page | **none** | layout only for the composition; `PREFERENCES.SCRIPT` says the four page doors deactivate the screen (the layout carries their targets) and the fifth button is `pf_b_mainmenu` out of flight (`activate(@mainmenu@)`) or `pf_b_returntogame` in flight. **Built as Original's Options screen over the section's chrome**: `PF_LOGO`, `PF_BACKGROUND`, `PF_T_TITLE`, the four description rows in their authored colour, the four page doors at their corners, `PF_B_GAMEOPTIONS` live in its four frames onto the Game Options page, `PF_B_AUDIO` live onto the AUDIO page, `PF_B_VIDEO` live onto the VIDEO page and `PF_B_CONTROLS` drawn disabled (no shared controls option stands behind it), and `PF_B_MAINMENU` as the way back. The page carries no content of its own: the shared options moved onto the three pages its live doors open. Remake-only: the disabled door, a state the original never shows. `PF_T_GODESC`'s decoded words describe the original's page, not ours, and stay as authored. `PF_B_RETURNTOGAME` is the in-flight variant and is not drawn; the pause board is out of scope |
| (none: remake-only) | Mode's Build Custom Plane, the Instant Action pick's door | none | none | none | **Original's wallet-free hangar entry, of our design under Decision 11.** The Instant Action screen's `IA_B_BUILD`, whose edge the layout does not state, opens the decoded name screen as the cabin's `PC_B_PLANEX` edge does, over the saved-plane store with no wallet, and CANCEL or a purchase return to the Instant Action screen with its Pilot Plane list re-read; the top level carries no door of its own, the original reaching plane construction only from the cabin and this button. What the cabin path would supply and this entry cannot (the wallet, the profile's ownership) is left out rather than invented: prices are never checked against funds and no row is marked. The hub's READY and CANCEL wear the export strips the Instant Action stills show (`PX_B_ReadyToExport`, `PX_B_CancelExport`), and the cash note reads the $50000 the hub's own `gui_init` writes on this door, a figure nothing on the path enforces |
| GameOptions | Options | 13 rows | no | `GameOptions.png` | layout only for the composition; the script creates all 13 rows, sends the choices out on accept (`callback($$E$$, 2128, 1, …)`) and drops them on cancel (`callback($$E$$, 2110)`), and both plaques state `Preferences` as their edge. **Built as Original's Game Options page**, `PF_B_GAMEOPTIONS`' destination: `GO_BACKGROUND` and `GO_T_TITLE` at their corners, then the shared options in the section's own row shape (a title in the `TITLEX` column at the row's line, a control in the `DROPX` column, a description in the `DESCX` column, rows at the authored 62-pixel pitch from the first row's Y 283), with `GO_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` leaving as the options apply carrying both choices and `GO_B_CANCELCHANGES` returning to Preferences with them dropped. The page opens on the saved options and never writes them. Row one is the original's own "Difficulty", `IDS_GO_DIFFICULTY_TITLE` over the `GO_D_DIFFICULTY` dropdown reading Normal, Hard or Hardest (the three `IDS_DIFFICULTY` rows), described by `IDS_GO_DIFFICULTY_DESC` "Select the difficulty level for a solo campaign."; the setting reaches only an enemy vehicle's armour and health maxima at spawn. Remake-only is the row under it: row two is "Menu", a dropdown over the two shipped presentations reading ORIGINAL or BUILT-IN, described "Select the menu presentation."; the graphics mode stands on the VIDEO page instead, the display setting it is. The page draws the Preferences page's `PF_LOGO`, its own section authoring no logo pane and the photograph showing one standing. **The plate holds three rows**: a fourth at the authored pitch would reach the plaque row at Y 457, so a further option past Difficulty needs either a taller plate (one image, so a stretched or tiled drawing is a remake reading to record) or paged rows |
| Audio | (none) | 19 rows | no | `Preferences Audio.png` | layout only for the composition; three preview loops are script-bound; both plaques state `Preferences` as their edge. **Built as Original's AUDIO page**, `PF_B_AUDIO`'s destination: `AP_BACKGROUND` and `AP_T_TITLE` at their corners, then four volume levels on their own authored rows (a title in the `TITLEX` 137 column at the row's line, a slider in the same column 26 pixels under it, a description in the `DESCX` 348 column at width 310), with `AP_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` leaving as the options apply carrying every saved choice and `AP_B_CANCELCHANGES` returning to Preferences with the edits dropped. Each row's line is read off its own title widget rather than off a first row and a pitch: the authored titles run 266, 324, 381 and 434, a pitch of 58, 57, 53 and 53, so one number would misplace every row under the second. The three authored sliders are identical but for their line (`MinValue 1, MaxValue 100, CurrentValue 50`, `PF_B_SliderSlot.png` under `PF_B_Slider.png`, the press region the slot grown by `Left 0, Top -10, Right 1, Bottom -10`), and each is honoured as authored: "Music Volume", "Effects Volume" and "Voice Volume" keep their titles and their descriptions. Remake-only is row one, "Master", which takes the In-Game Music checkbox's authored row with the page's own title and description "Set the overall volume. It scales the three levels below it."; its slider stands at the slider column and offset rather than at `AP_B_MUSIC`'s own corner, that widget being a checkbox authored at X 259 on the title's own line. The range every slider takes is 0 to 100 rather than the authored 1 to 100, since one step below the authored floor is what makes a category mutable at all, which is the whole of what the In-Game Music checkbox did; the checkbox is therefore not drawn. A slider answers no Accept: the level moves under the pointer or by a sideways step of 5, clamped at both ends. The page draws the Preferences page's `PF_LOGO`, its own section authoring no logo pane. **The row that does not come back** is Sound Quality: the authored dropdown tiered a 2000-era mixer's sample rate and voice count, which is why the original had to quit and restart to change it (`IDS_AP_QUALITYCHANGED`), and Godot's mixer has no equivalent tier |
| Video | (none) | 31 rows | no | `Preferences Video.png` | layout only for the composition; both plaques state `Preferences` as their edge. **Built as Original's VIDEO page**, `PF_B_VIDEO`'s destination: `VP_BACKGROUND` and `VP_T_TITLE` at their corners, then the settings on their own authored rows (a title in the `X` 18 column at the row's line, a control beside it, a description in the `X` 325 column), with `VP_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` leaving as the options apply carrying every saved choice and `VP_B_CANCELCHANGES` returning to Preferences with the edits dropped. Each row keeps its own geometry rather than a shared pitch: the authored lines run 270, 305, 342, 381, 417, 454, 494, 530, 565 and each control has its own column and width, so a fixed pitch would put no row where the artwork draws it. Remake-only are the rows built so far, held in the table in authored order because the cursor walks it. "Resolution" stands on its own authored line, a dropdown at `VP_D_Display`'s own column and width over the sizes the chosen screen can hold, keeping the authored description "Select the screen resolution." because that line describes what the row does here. Its words are enumerated per screen rather than shipped as a list, so it cannot offer a size the monitor cannot hold; Godot exposes no video-mode list, so the enumeration is the standard desktop sizes that fit inside the screen's own reported size, plus that size and the project default. A saved size the screen no longer offers shows as the project default rather than as the nearest one, which is the rule `ResolutionSetting` applies. "Monitor" stands on the authored Graphics line, the page's first row, a dropdown at `VP_D_Device`'s own column and width over the screens the engine reports, each labelled by the index it is saved as and the size that screen reports, described "Select the monitor the game opens on." Both its title and its description are the page's own, the authored pair naming a 3D card or a software renderer and this port having neither a card choice nor a software path. A saved index no screen answers to shows as the screen the window already stands on, which is the rule `MonitorSetting` applies and is the feature rather than an error path, a monitor being unpluggable between two launches. "Display Mode" stands on the authored Viewing Range line, a dropdown at `VP_D_View`'s own column and width reading Windowed, Borderless or Fullscreen, described "Select how the window sits on the screen. Borderless leaves the desktop beneath it."; it takes that row because the two above it are the monitor and the resolution, and its authored description names a draw distance the mission data owns. "V-Sync" stands on the authored Effects Level line, a dropdown at `VP_D_Effects`' own column and width reading On, Off, or one of the 60, 120 and 144 fps caps, described "Select the frame pacing. On follows the screen; off runs free, or to a frame cap."; one control carries both the choice and the cap, a cap meaning nothing while the loop waits for the screen. It takes that row because the three authored rows above it are where the monitor, the resolution and the display mode belong, which is the order those read in, and its authored description names a tier system this port has no counterpart for. "Enhanced Graphics" stands on the authored Shadows line, a checkbox drawn from `PF_B_CheckBoxSmall.png` at `VP_B_SHADOWS`' own corner, described "Select the lit world. Takes effect on the next start." while the choice matches the running mode and "This run is original; restart to apply." (or enhanced) while it does not, since the mode resolves once at launch and a saved word the world has not picked up would otherwise read as a failed switch. It takes the Shadows row because the sun shadows that row would have switched already ride the enhanced gate, and because that row's authored title box is the wide one a long title needs. Two numbers the section does not state are derived: a title box stops at the control beside it (every Video title but the Graphics one is authored 162 wide whatever stands to its right, and that one's 90 already stops short of `VP_D_Device` at 105), and a description the section gives no width wraps at the plaque column, the widthless `VP_T_ClutterDESC` and `VP_T_ShadowsDESC` being the two rows the plaques stand beside. The page draws the Preferences page's `PF_LOGO`, its own section authoring no logo pane. **The rows still empty** are Objects Detail, Lighting Quality, Texture Quality and Clutter Detail, which do not come back: they were tiers for 2000-era hardware, and the knobs nearest to them here are either fidelity values the mission data owns or settings that cost nothing on a modern GPU |
| ControlsPrefs | Options' Controls row | 12 rows | no | `still-t084-controls-page.png` | layout only for the composition; both plaques state `Preferences` as their edge and `CP_B_KEYS` states `Keys`. **Built as Original's CONTROLS page**, `PF_B_CONTROLS`' destination: `CP_BACKGROUND` and `CP_T_TITLE` at their corners, the KEYS AND BUTTONS door at its own, `CP_T_KeysDesc` as authored, and the two plaques with ACCEPT CHANGES left of CANCEL CHANGES as the section authors them. Remake-only is the first row: the seat chooser takes `CP_D_Fly`'s Controller Type box, a dropdown over the seats the shared feature holds reading "Player 1", described "Whose keymap KEYS AND BUTTONS edits. Each seat holds its own."; this port has no controller-type tier, every device being bindable on the page behind the door, and the seat is the one thing that page needs choosing. Joining is open here, which is what puts a second player's keymap on screen at all. **The row that comes back as something else** is Mouse Sensitivity: the cursor is the desktop's own and no sensitivity setting exists to move, so `CP_S_MOUSE`'s box carries this port's flying scheme instead, a two-value chooser reading "Look" or "Fly" under the title "Mouse", with its own description; the slider's slot and thumb are not drawn. ACCEPT CHANGES writes the staged keymaps through the feature and CANCEL CHANGES drops them, both returning to Preferences; neither is the options apply, a keymap being no field of the options file |
| Keys | Options' Controls row | 17 rows | no | `Keybinds Movement/Throttle/Targeting/Weapons/Views 1/Views 2/Other.png`, `still-t096-keys-and-buttons-page.png` | composition of all seven tabs; no interaction. **Built as Original's KEYS AND BUTTONS page**, `CP_B_KEYS`' destination: `KB_BACKGROUND` and `KB_T_TITLE` at their corners, the seven `KB_B_CAT` strips down the left column with the standing one in its depressed frame, the three authored column heads, the action list in `KB_L_Controls`' own window and pitch under a heading naming the standing category, `KB_B_RESET`, and the exit pair the section authors the other way round from every other leaf's, `KB_B_CANCELCHANGES` at X 202 left of `KB_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` at X 511 on one line at Y 550, which is what the still shows. **The seven tabs are the original's action groups, not this port's three keymaps.** Movement, Throttle, Weapons, Targeting, Views 1 and Views 2 name flight actions and take them; Other takes every action those six leave over, which is the session commands plus the whole of the menu and free-camera keymaps, since the original binds neither and a faithful strip would otherwise strand them. A tab claims each action exactly once, so a new action lands on Other rather than nowhere. **Control A and Control B are positions, not fields**: this port holds an unbounded list per action, so Control A prints the first control and Control B the second followed by the count it is not showing, and the slot cursor walks the whole list including the empty place past its end. A click on a cell arms a capture on that cell's own action and slot, the page swallowing the frame while one runs; Escape or the pad's Back abandons it. ACCEPT CHANGES writes the staged keymaps and CANCEL CHANGES drops them, both returning to ControlsPrefs. Remake-only: the category heading over the rows, the keyboard and pad focus, and two clamps the data forces, the authored list width putting its scrollbar at X 844 and the Control B column ending at X 815 against a plate that ends at 797, so each is clamped to the plate's own right edge |
| Credits | (none: Built-in has no counterpart) | 3 rows | this page | **none** | `CREDITS.SCRIPT` decoded: the background pane, ABOUT, and the DONE plaque whose `ScriptToExe` is MainMenu; `gui_char` ends the script and runs `mainmenu.script` on Escape. **Built as Original's credits screen** from the full-screen pane the credit names are painted into, the two buttons over it, and both ways back landing on the top level. `CR_B_Exit` wears MomentoSelection's `MS_B_Done.png`; there is no `CR_B_Exit.png`. **ABOUT** raises the one-button box the press asks for: setting `@globals@OR.XR` switches the messagebox to the `ma_` widget set over `CR_AboutMessageBox.png` (505x416, centred at 147,92) and takes the skull icon, which stays `mb_p_icon` at its own place whatever the set. Its words are `uiData` 2108 (`0x0040a2cb`), langui 1301 formatted over the product id `FUN_004073d0` reads from `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\Crimson Skies\1.0`, value `PID`, which falls back to `???` when the key or the value is absent, and `???` is what this port always shows, reading no registry. That row's `&&` is drawn as authored: every other langui row spells a literal ampersand singly (`Pratt & Whitney`), so the text widgets eat no `&`. **The right-button line** is read: `rbutton_update` activates a text widget at 288,308 in `0xffffff00` while the right button is held inside 287..353 by 313..333, its line built by shifting each character of an obfuscated literal down by three (`CREDITS.SCRIPT:63-72`), and the transitions count only inside that region, so a hold carried out of it leaves the line standing |
| InstantAction | Environment, MissionType, Waves, WaveEdit, Wingmen, Plane, Presets | 48 rows | [`instant-action.md`](../formats/instant-action.md) | **none** | option sets, the ace's control hiding and the paged enemy rows are script-proven; the screen itself has never been seen. **Built as Original's Instant Action screen** from the section's rows over the shared feature: `IA_BackGround`, the `T` rows, the contents list in its 14-row window with its own scroll arrows and slider, the dropdowns on their authored lines, the enemy rows paged by `IA_B_UP`/`IA_B_DOWN`, the radio pair, View Story, Fly Mission and Exit; `IA_B_BUILD` opens the wallet-free hangar and `IA_B_CHANGEWEAPONS` the Weapon Loadout screen for the seat the radio pair names (both destinations remake readings, no layout row stating either edge). What the data does not settle is listed under Part 4 for `CAP-50` |
| OrdinanceLayout (as Instant Action's Weapon Loadout) | `WingmanLoadout`, the plane pane's loadout | 31 rows | same | same | **Built as Original's Instant Action loadout screen** over the same section: the ammunition fields for the airframe's firable gun slots and the rocket fields for its pylons (left column pylons 1 to 4, right 5 to 8), each over the stock table's option list, the two diagram panes on the airframe's frame, `OL_T_PLANEINFO` naming the fitted aircraft, the focused field's description in its pane, `OL_B_ACCEPT` keeping the picks and `OL_B_CANCEL` or Back restoring the picks the screen opened on. Remake-only: the original reaches this section from the flight check alone |
| Campaign (profile) | `CampaignScreen.Roster` | 6 rows | [`campaign-screens.md`](../formats/campaign-screens.md) | `Campaign Player Profile.png` | full: roster fill, name validator, all four exits. **Built as Original's profile screen** over the shared campaign feature and the shared board component: the name box pre-filled with the last player seated, `CM_B_START` / Enter in the box / a second click on the filled roster row starting, a first click filling the box and a click in the box itself taking the caret and nothing else, the list sub-script's own selection bar and pointer frame, the four refusals as the one-button messagebox, `CM_B_DELETEPLAYER` asking with langui 201 as the two-button box whose answers read Yes and No (langui 102 and 103, the words `MESSAGEBOX.SCRIPT` gives a `0x4` box), `CM_B_CANCEL` leaving. The box opens on Yes, the left button `MESSAGEBOX.SCRIPT` focuses for the plain `0x4` mask the campaign passes. Remake-only: the caret |
| PassengerCabin | `Cabin` | 16 rows | same | `Campaign CAP-44 Cabin.png` | full for the six buttons; whether anything on the screen animates is open. **Built as Original's cabin**: the five plaques the board component draws, `PC_B_NEWMISSION` disabled once the campaign is complete, `PC_B_PLANEX` into the name screen over the profile's wallet with the cabin as the hangar's return, `PC_B_CHANGEMOMENTO` into the memento chooser, `PC_B_PREVIOUS` and `PC_B_RETURNMM` on their layout edges |
| MomentoSelection | `MementoSelection` | 7 rows | same | **none** | full: `MOMENTOSELECTION.SCRIPT` and the award table behind `uiData` 2150 are decoded. **Built as Original's memento chooser** through the shared page: the scrapbook photograph under its reflection, the two arrows stepping the pictures the profile holds, ACCEPT writing the chosen name into the profile and CANCEL leaving the cabin's wall as it was |
| FlightCheck | `FlightCheck` | 25 rows | same | `Campaign Flight Check.png`, `… Change Plane Button.png` | full: both slots, four lists, the wingman gate, both plane-change rules. **Built as Original's flight check**: the paper plaques per crew slot hit-tested at their rows, `FC_B_RETURNBRIEF` rewinding a co-op walk, `FC_B_FLYMISSION` advancing to the next joined human's check or leaving as the feature's launch with every seat's devices; a joined seat drives its own check |
| PlaneSelection | `PlaneSelection` | 27 rows | same | `… Change Plane.png`, `… Combo Box.png`, `… Unique Warning.png`, `… Export dialog.png` | full, including the rollover preview and the duplicate rule. **Built as Original's plane selection** through the shared page: the fields at their `D` rows with the open list's entries hit-tested under the box, a sideways step on the closed field, the 710 refusal and the 702 export message as Original's own messagebox. Remake-only: the rollover preview is not drawn (the page previews nothing on a highlight) |
| OrdinanceLayout | `Ammo` | 31 rows | same | `… Change Ammo Menu.png`, `… ComboBox.png`, `Campaign Ammo Selection.png` | full. **Built as Original's ammo selection** through the shared page: the twelve fields, the description pane following the focused field, ACCEPT and CANCEL back onto the plaque that opened the screen |
| ScrapBook | `Scrapbook` | 46 rows | same + [`debrief.md`](debrief.md) | `Campaign Scrapbook CM01 Story Scraps.png` | full. **Built as Original's book** through the shared page: every scrap hit-tested on its `SCRAPBOOK.CSV` region (the picture's own bounds where the row authors `0,0,0,0`), the arrows, tabs, bookmark and buttons at their rows, Back returning to the contents or the cabin, whichever opened it |
| ScrapBook_TOC | `PreviousMissions` | 8 rows | same | `Campaign CAP-41 Previous Mission 1/2.png` | full. **Built as Original's table of contents** through the shared page: the mission rows hit-tested inside the listbox's window, a click picking and a second click replaying, the buttons at their rows |
| ScrapbookZoom | `ScrapbookZoom` | 83 rows | same | `Campaign Scrapbook CM02 Mission select….png` | full. **Built as Original's zoom** through the shared page: `SBZ_B_RETURN` and `SBZ_B_EXPORT`, the export's 705/706 as Original's messagebox |
| (Briefing, a `zrdr` dialog, not a script) | `Briefing` | none | [`briefing.md`](../formats/briefing.md) | `Campaign Briefing.png` | full. **Built as Original's briefing**: the three `brief_button1` plaques at the dialog's own positions with their label-face states, the reveal advanced on the presentation's clock, the narration begun through the shared audio service on entry and again on REPLAY BRIEFING and ended on RETURN TO CABIN and GO TO FLIGHT CHECK |
| Hangar | `HangarScreen.PlaneSelection` | 16 rows | [`hangar.md`](hangar.md) | `CustomPlane PlaneSelection.png` | callbacks and economy decoded; navigation only from the layout. **Built as Original's INVENTORY**, the hub's SELL PLANES destination (a remake reading: `PX_B_Sell` states no edge): `HA_BACKGROUND`, the title and prompt, `HA_D_PILOTPLANE` over the shared feature's saved planes, the picked plane's `HA_P_PILOTPLANE` frame, name, agility, armour, value (1258) and guns, `HA_B_SELLP` asking first with the two-button messagebox (langui 700 over the short airframe name and the plane's value, Yes and No) and refusing as the one-button box (704 for a reward aircraft, 701 below the two-plane floor) before selling or deleting through the feature, `HA_B_EXPORTP` live beside it, answering with langui 702 over the short airframe name and writing nothing (the remake's two presentations already share one plane store), `HA_B_DONE` back to the tab. The sell messagebox is the plane selection screen's own decoded path (`campaign-screens.md`), applied here to the remake's inventory |
| PlaneName | `Name` | 8 rows | partly | `CustomPlane Name Dialog.png`, `CustomPlane Name Dialog No Name.png` | the edit box's font and colours are authored; nothing about the validator here. **Built as Original's name screen**: the pane centred on the board with the section's rows relative to it ([`menu-layout.md`](../formats/menu-layout.md)), `PN_E_NAME` fed by seat 0's typed characters under the shared feature's character set and 32-character cap with a blinking caret in its own `CursorColor`, `PN_B_DEFAULT` (checked as authored) choosing the default configuration or a bare airframe, `PN_B_OK` always live and answering an empty box with langui 203 as the script's one-button messagebox, `PN_B_CANCEL` dropping the build; the original's `MaxChars` of 16 is not applied, the saved-plane index's 32 is |
| PlaneConstruction | (no counterpart; Built-in has no hub) | 47 rows | [`hangar.md`](hangar.md) | `Campaign CAP-40 Plane Construction 1/2.png` | composition; the tab bar's own behaviour is unseen. **Built as Original's Plane Construction hub**: the background, the plane at the `PX_P_PLANE` corner (the airframe's blueprint, or the `PX_ICON` set tinted with the picked colours), the PLANE NAME title with `PX_E_NAME` as an edit box over the scratch plane's name (the script's own run from the title's end to 302), PLANE COST as the running total and red past the wallet, AIRFRAME, WEIGHT CAPACITY, CURRENT WEIGHT red over capacity, every one of them following the row under the cursor in an open list, the weight line alone going pending and plain under the airframe list, the agility and armour words with their `PX_BarGraph` segments, the cash note on both doors (the wallet's funds, else the export door's own $50000), the six `PX_Tab` tabs as siblings with the standing one drawn in its depressed frame and still hittable, `PX_B_Sell`, `PX_B_Ready` and `PX_B_Cancel`. What the data does not settle is listed under Part 4 for `CAP-53` |
| AirFrame | `Airframe` | 4 rows | [`hangar.md`](hangar.md) | none | the airframe stat table is decoded; the screen is four widgets over it. **Built as the hub's airframe tab**: `AF_D_AIRFRAME` picking through the shared feature and raising the langui 206 ask as a dialog, `AF_T_AIRFRAME` and `AF_S_AIRFRAMEDESC` following the focused airframe |
| Engine | `Engine` | 4 rows | same | none | as above. **Built as the engine tab** over `EN_D_ENGINE` (six engines then None) |
| Armor | `Armour` | 14 rows | same | none | as above. **Built as the armor tab** over `AR_D_POINT0..3` (None then 5 to 60 units in fives) |
| Guns | `Guns` | 14 rows | same | none | as above. **Built as the guns tab** over `GN_D_GUN0..3` (the eleven-row cycle) with the airframe's slot titles |
| HardPoints | `Hardpoints` | 9 rows | same | none | as above. **Built as the hardpoints tab** over `HP_D_POINT0..1` |
| Paint | `Paint` | 27 rows | same + [`rof.md`](../formats/rof.md) | 8 `CustomPlane Paint*.png` | composition well covered by the paint stills; the pattern pickers' behaviour is not. **Built as the paint tab**: `PT_D_PATTERN` over the wearable patterns, `PT_D_COLORS0..2` as swatches in an 18-row window, `PT_D_SHADES0..2`, `PT_D_DECALS0..2` as `PT_P_DECALS` tiles in a two-row window |
| Purchase | `Purchase` | 29 rows | same | none | the purchase gate and cost are decoded from the executable. **Built as the hub's totals page**, READY TO PURCHASE's destination: the column heads, one line per priced component at the authored lines and text lists, the totals, `PUR_T_PROBLEMS` in the commit's words, `PUR_B_PURCHASE` live while the feature can commit |
| MessageBox | (the `_error` line) | 16 rows | [`campaign-screens.md`](../formats/campaign-screens.md) | two campaign dialogs | the `@globals@OR` parameter block and the button masks are decoded; the script also gives the buttons their words by mask, langui 100 (OK) on the `0x1` box, 102 and 103 (Yes, No) on the `0x4` pair and 102, 103 and 101 (Yes, No, Cancel) across all three slots of the `0x8` box, and its Escape takes the right answer of whichever mask stands. **Built as Original's dialog over any screen**: the `0x1` box on `MB_B_CENTER` for every refusal and notice (the profile screen's four, the plane screen's 710 and 702, the zoom's 705 and 706, the inventory's 701 and 704), the `0x4` box on `MB_B_LEFT`/`MB_B_RIGHT` for the delete confirm and the sell confirm, the `0x8` box across all three for the airframe swap's 206 (`hangar.md`, "When the airframe swap asks"), the answers in the script's words, a box opening on its first answer (the left button the script focuses, so a `0x4` or `0x8` box opens on Yes), Back taking the last answer, which is the one the script's Escape posts; while a box stands its answers are the only rows. **Rollover and focus are separate in the original and stay separate here.** `gui_init` focuses a button on every raise (`DX` when `0x20` or `0x40` is set, else `CX` on the `0x1` box, else `BX`) and sets no frame with it: the reference shot of a `0x1` box has its focused OK on the normal frame with the pointer elsewhere, so the strip's rollover frame answers the pointer alone. Ours draws it that way and gives the cursor the `DISABLED` focus outline the option pages already use, three pixels clear of the strip and only while the pointer is elsewhere, since one cursor here serves pad, keyboard and pointer together. The widget set is a parameter of the same composer, the `mb_` rows by default and the `ma_` rows for the credits screen's About box, with the icon row left on `mb_p_icon` in either |

⚠ **Built-in has no counterpart for GameOptions, Video, Audio or
PlaneConstruction (its Options screen is Preferences' counterpart, and its one Controls row stands
for both of the original's rebinding pages), and the original has no
counterpart for Free Flight, Dogfight, the Chapter screen or the wave editor.** The two shells are
not the same graph, which is what Decision 4 already allows; what this row adds is the size of it.

### How the option pages ink and mark focus

Remake-only readings shared by the Options family (the Preferences page and the Game Options, AUDIO
and VIDEO pages behind its doors), each composed over a painted plate. The layout authors colours
per screen and a button's rollover and depressed frames, but nothing that marks the row a keyboard
or pad walk stands on, those pages being pointer-driven. The mark and the ink it takes are ours.

**The palette.** `OriginalPresentation.PaletteFor` inks these pages from the Preferences page's
authored description colour for row text and its title colour for the heading, the paper plaque's
own label tail for the chooser, and the file-wide `ACTIVE` for the focused row rather than that
title colour. The authored title is a duller grey than the description cream every unfocused row is
written in, so a row focused in it reads as the disabled one, and `ACTIVE` is what every other
Original screen already focuses with.

**The focus box.** `OriginalShell.FocusBox` outlines the focused row, shared by the slider rows and
by the dropdown rows that take `boxOnFocus`, so one outline covers every marked row on these pages.
It is drawn in the layout's own `DISABLED` grey rather than the dropdown's authored black, which on
dark paint is a dark line nobody sees. It is a mark rather than standing chrome: on every row at
once it is a permanent hard box around rectangles the layout authors at differing widths, so only
the row the cursor is on carries it.

**The box and the wash on a slider row.** A slider thumb is one frame with no focused or pressed
state, so a focused slider row is the box together with a wash under it. The box is the half that
reads: the wash lands over a press region grown around a three-pixel slot, so on its own it is a
faint band over mostly background. The wash stays because the box needs a region to enclose;
without one the outline reads as four loose lines. When neither the slot nor the thumb art
measures, both stand as rectangles instead, the way a missing plaque leaves an outlined label, so
the control still shows its level.

**Why the plate is backdrop.** A composed board draws its fills between the backdrop and the
pictures, so a page that puts its logo and its background plate among the pictures buries every
focus mark its rows compose under opaque art. Each option page adds both to the backdrop instead.

### Menu audio

`LAYOUT.CSV` authors no audio. Every menu sound is bound in a script, and the whole set is eight
files in `ASSETS/SOUNDS/`.

| File | Bound in | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `MOUSECLICK.WAV` | `GLOBALS.SCRIPT`, played by `CTL.SCRIPT` on a click | button press |
| `MOUSEOVER.WAV` | same, on a rollover | button rollover |
| `ENTERTEXT.WAV` | `GLOBALS.SCRIPT` | edit-box keystroke |
| `ENTERTEXT_ERROR.WAV` | same | edit-box reject |
| `MUSIC_SPLASH.WAV` | `GLOBALS.SCRIPT`'s one `@ctl@SK` sound object, channel 5, continuous | the shell's only music; every out-of-mission screen drives that one object |
| `MUSIC_LOOP.WAV` | `AUDIO.SCRIPT` | the Audio page's music-volume preview |
| `SFX_LOOP.WAV` | same | the effects-volume preview |
| `VOICE_LOOP.WAV` | same | the voice-volume preview |

Transport is message-driven: `11001` play, `11002` loop, `11000` stop, `11003`/`11004` pause and
resume through `uiControl` 2503/2504. There is no cue-name indirection; scripts name raw `.wav`
files.

**Built-in plays none of these.** `LaunchMenu` owns exactly two audio behaviours: it enters
`MusicState.Menu` on every screen, and it asks the shared audio service for the briefing narration,
which ducks the music. There is no click, no rollover and no keystroke sound anywhere in Built-in.
**Original requests the first four through the shared service** (`MenuCueTable`): `MOUSEOVER` on
entering a live button, `MOUSECLICK` on pressing one, `ENTERTEXT` per character an edit box takes
and `ENTERTEXT_ERROR` per character it refuses, on the top level, the Instant Action screen, the
hangar and the campaign screens alike, and nothing on a list row or a scrap; the briefing's
narration is begun on entry and on REPLAY BRIEFING and ended on every door out. Which sound the
original plays where is `CAP-52`'s to confirm.

## Part 3: assets, required and optional

**Required** means a screen Original composes cannot be drawn without it; **optional** means the
screen degrades locally and stays usable. The runtime manifest
(`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/Original/OriginalAssetManifest.cs`) derives that classification from the decoded
layout on every start, so this section is the reading and the manifest is the enforcement. Over the
install's own layout it classifies **99 required** and **63 optional** files, and over a complete
extraction it reports no absence at all: `ExtractRof.ps1` copies the loose MPGs in, so the two
movies the layout names are on disk with everything else.

⚠ **The manifest cannot be generated from `LAYOUT.CSV` alone.** The layout names 124 distinct art
files; the archive ships 681 PNG, 143 TGA, 107 JPG and 25 TIF. The rest are named by scripts
(`ACTIVEPOINTERZ.PNG`, `PASSIVEPOINTERZ.PNG`, `ARIAL8.TGA`) or built at runtime by string
concatenation (`"assets\graphics\pc_p_hangar" + <airframe> + ".jpg"`,
`"assets\graphics\scrapbook\" + <name>`, and the per-pattern `.BM` sets). `menu_layout.json`
carries both halves, complete names and the fragments a runtime name is assembled from, and the
manifest classifies the complete names alone. `ZOOMPOINTER.PNG` and `PX_<n>_BLUEPRINT.TGA` appear
in neither half: see the closing section. Of the layout's own names, 101 are in the 23 sections
Original composes and 27 only outside them; seven of the 101 sit in rows no composed screen draws,
which is why the required count is 94 layout names plus the five the scripts name.

| Class | Files | Manifest class | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `menu_layout.json` (from `LAYOUT.CSV`) | 1 | **required**, ahead of the manifest | absent means no geometry at all, and no manifest to derive; the availability check answers with the missing path |
| `extracted/VERSION.json` | 1 | **required** when it is behind the stamp schema Original reads | a tree with no stamp still runs; the check is `ExtractionStamp.Behind` |
| screen backgrounds of the 23 composed sections (`MM_`, `PF_`, `GO_`, `IA_`, `CM_`, `PC_`, `FC_`, `PS_`, `OL_`, `SB_`, `PX_`, `MB_`) | 12 families | **required** | a screen with no backdrop is not a degraded screen |
| button strips of the composed sections | 122 `B` rows over ~62 PNGs | **required** | four stacked frames, disabled / normal / rollover / depressed; the words are painted in, so the state is entirely which frame draws |
| shared widget chrome (`GN_`, `FC_B_Scroll*`, `PX_B_Scroll*`, `CM_B_Scroll*`, `IA_B_Scroll*`, the dropdown arrows) | ~12 | **required** | named through `[GLOBALVARS]` macros, so one miss hits many screens |
| `ARIAL8.TGA` | 1 | **required** | the global 3D font; the string table's `[FONTID]` tags name `.ttf` faces the archive does not carry, and `FONT.TGA` is named by nothing |
| `ACTIVEPOINTERZ.PNG`, `PASSIVEPOINTERZ.PNG` | 2 | **required** | script-named and drawn on every screen; Built-in draws no pointer at all (`BL-654`) |
| `PX_B_ReadyToExport.png`, `PX_B_CancelExport.png` | 2 | **required** | script-named, drawn by the plane construction hub; no layout row names them |
| `ZOOMPOINTER.PNG` | 1 | not classified | named in neither the layout nor an external-asset entry, and Original draws the two pointers above on the zoom too |
| `GO_BackGround.png`, `PF_B_AcceptChanges.png`, `PF_B_CancelChanges.png`, `PF_B_CheckBoxSmall.Png` | 4 | **required** | the Game Options page draws every art name its section carries; the dropdown's arrow and scroll set are the shared chrome above |
| `AP_`, `VP_`, `CP_`, `KB_` page art | 4 families | optional | the four remaining Preferences pages are out of scope, so no composed screen draws them |
| `GN_B_ReturnToGame.Png` | 1 | optional | `[Preferences]`' in-flight way back; the menu's page offers `PC_B_ReturnMainMenu.png` instead |
| `CR_AboutMessageBox.png` | 1 | **required** | the About box's own background, drawn by the credits screen's box |
| `MessageBox`'s `MP_*` rows, its `MA_B_LEFT`/`MA_B_RIGHT`, and the art of every section outside the 23 | 3 + 27 | optional | no local counterpart for the multiplayer error box, and the About box is the one-button box, so its left and right rows never draw |
| `ui_strings.json` + `RESOURCE.H` | 2 | optional | 152 symbols referenced, 149 resolve; `UiStrings` falls back to an empty table, so the screens draw with no words rather than not at all |
| `SCRAPBOOK.CSV` | 1 | optional | 461 rows; the book's extent is the file's extent, and without it the book lists nothing |
| `MOUSECLICK`, `MOUSEOVER`, `ENTERTEXT`, `ENTERTEXT_ERROR` | 4 | optional | a silent menu is usable |
| `MUSIC_SPLASH.WAV`, `MUSIC_LOOP`, `SFX_LOOP`, `VOICE_LOOP` | 4 | optional (the loops are not classified) | the three loop names carry no directory in the scripts, so the manifest has no path to check |
| `PC_P_HANGAR0..10.JPG` | 11 | not classified | assembled at runtime from a fragment; the cabin's window photo, and the painted cabin reads without it |
| `PX_0..10_BLUEPRINT.TGA` | 11 | not classified | assembled at runtime; `IHangarPage.Art` already returns null on a miss |
| scrapbook art | 238 files | not classified | assembled at runtime; a `Snap_*` row is already skipped when the file is not on disk |
| paint `.BM` masks | 184 | not classified | assembled at runtime per pattern; 14 pattern folders, `FORTUNE` has all 62 skins, `BLCKSWAN` 5 |
| `CrimFlag.MPG`, `Final.MPG` | 2 | optional | `LAYOUT.CSV` names both under `extracted/rof/ASSETS/GRAPHICS/MPG/`, where `ExtractRof.ps1` puts the install's loose MPGs; `CrimFlag.MPG` is the top level's and Preferences' backdrop, on an 8.0 s loop ([`../formats/cinemas.md`](../formats/cinemas.md)), and runs behind the five Preferences leaves too, which author no row of their own and show it in every leaf still; a screen whose movie is missing draws whole without it |
| `MM_BackGround.png`, `MM_SplashBackground.jpg` | 2 | not classified | neither appears in any layout row, and the shipped `MM_BackGround.png` is a placeholder reading "CS BACKGROUND" |

**Not classified** means the manifest carries no entry: the name is assembled at runtime from a
fragment rather than written out, so there is no file list to check before entry. Those degrade
where they are drawn, and the pages that draw them already handle a miss.

⚠ **The original's own top-level backdrop is a movie the extraction does not carry, and the still
beside it is a placeholder.** Original's main menu therefore has no faithful background
available. That is an accepted remake-only rule to write down, not a missing asset to hunt for.

## Part 4: what the evidence does not cover

### Owed captures

Filed in [`playtest.md`](../../playtest.md) under **Menus and front end**. The first takes of all
of them were filmed with a silent audio track, so what they settled is the picture, recorded in the
paragraphs below, and what they still owe is listed per row; `CAP-49`'s row is retired, its open
halves riding `CAP-52`.

| ID | What it still owes | What it unblocks |
|---|---|---|
| `CAP-50` | VIEW STORY pressed on the Instant Action page | what that button opens, the one Instant Action state no take holds |
| `CAP-51` | the AUDIO page with sound, and a leaf re-entered after CANCEL CHANGES | the AUDIO page's preview against the decoded script, and whether a leaf's CANCEL CHANGES reverts a setting |
| `CAP-52` | the whole menu walk with sound routed, a keyboard and pad pressed on each screen, REPLAY BRIEFING and DELETE PLAYER pressed | A4's audio and input contracts, D33's cue work, the focus walk this page still calls a remake equivalence |
| `CAP-53` | the tab bar out of order, Purchase, the cleared default box, the two refusals | C23's Original hangar navigation |

### Where Built-in and the original disagree

Each of these is a divergence a reader could mistake for a decode, so each is named.

- **The original's top level has six rows, and none of them is Free Flight, Dogfight or a hangar
  door.** `[@MainMenu@]` authors Campaign, Instant Action, Multiplayer, Preferences, Credits and
  Quit. Built-in's Mode screen offers Free Flight, Instant Action, Dogfight, Campaign and Build
  Custom Plane. Free Flight is entirely ours; Dogfight is splitscreen where the original's
  equivalent is network multiplayer; Original reaches plane construction where the original does,
  from the Instant Action screen's BUILD button and from the cabin, and has no top-level door.
- **Original Free Flight has no original screen behind it.** There is no free-flight script, no
  free-flight art, and no free-flight entry in the Instant Action mission-type dropdown. The
  remake-only rule under Decision 11 stands: Original's top level carries a Free Flight door and a
  Free Flight screen of our design, composed in the decoded chrome's conventions (the paper-plaque
  text button, the four state colours, the logo) and marked remake-only in the screen census above.
- **Original Dogfight and its join flow have no original screen behind them either.** The
  original's Multiplayer branch is network play (the 22 multiplayer scripts, none with a layout),
  and no script or layout row describes a second local player joining. The same remake-only rule
  gives Original a Dogfight door under the Free Flight door, a Dogfight screen in the Free Flight
  screen's shape, and Built-in's own join gesture (Start on a free pad) with the seats, picks and
  gate shared through the player-setup feature; all marked remake-only in the census above.
- **The wallet-free path's own verbs are partly remake-only.** Its totals page commits with
  Export, which the stills show and the shipped table carries as `IDS_PS_B_EXPORT` (`langui` 1139)
  for the inventory's own button; there is no export label authored for `PUR_B_PURCHASE`, so the
  id is borrowed. Its inventory drops the Export row entirely (Instant Action has nowhere to
  export to, both presentations picking out of the one build store) and calls the removal Delete
  on the button, over the page and in the confirm, which no shipped string carries for a plane:
  700 and 1256 both price and name a sale. The confirm keeps the sale confirm's shape, the `0x4`
  two-button query box with Yes and No. It also leaves the picked plane's Value row (1258) unwritten,
  that row being a sale's worth: what the cabin path supplies and this door cannot is left out
  rather than invented, which is the same rule that checks no price against the $50000 note.
- **Original's wallet-free hub entry and its Instant Action loadout screen have no original screen
  behind them.** The original reaches plane construction from the cabin (`PC_B_PLANEX`, to
  `PlaneName`) and from the Instant Action screen's `IA_B_BUILD`, whose edge no layout row states,
  as no row states `IA_B_CHANGEWEAPONS`'s; the remake-only rule under Decision 11 has `IA_B_BUILD`
  open the same name screen with no wallet, the hub then wearing the export strips and the $50000
  cash note the Instant Action stills show, and `IA_B_CHANGEWEAPONS` open the `[@OrdinanceLayout@]`
  chrome over the pilot's or the wingmen's shared fit. Marked remake-only in the census above.

### What the Original presentation implements from the data, and what the captures must confirm

The main menu's interaction is built from what the layout itself evidences: a `B` row's four
stacked frames imply a rollover state under the pointer and a depressed state while pressed, so
the plaque under the pointer draws frame 2 and draws frame 3 while the button is held; the two
pointer bitmaps the globals script names are drawn as the pointer, the active one over a live
button and the passive one elsewhere; the two wavs the control library binds play on a rollover
and on a press. ⚠ **A main-menu plaque's three lettering colours are in the art, not in a colour
tail.** The `MM_B_` rows carry no `ResID` and so no `ColorActive`/`ColorRollover`/`ColorDepressed`
("Colors should only be specified if ResID is specified", the file's own comment block), and the
words are painted into the four frames: measured over the frames that differ, `MM_B_Preferences.png`
inks its glyph cores `FEDE91` at rest, `FFA741` under the pointer and `F83F3F` while held. Only a
row whose text the engine draws, a paper plaque such as `FC_B_CHANGEPLANE`, reads its states off a
tail. The film (`CAP-49`, `CAP-52`, both silent) shows the top level this way: the
movie fills the 4:3 frame edge to edge behind the plaques, loops on a cycle near eight seconds,
keeps running in phase behind Preferences and every leaf page, and nothing but the plaque under
the pointer changes; a plaque has three states that differ only in lettering colour, gold at
rest, orange under the pointer and red while held, the rollover arriving on the frame the hot
point enters the box; a press fires on the release, never on the button-down (Quit held for 1.4 s
did nothing until released); Multiplayer is a live plaque like the other five, and no take draws
any plaque disabled, while Original keeps it in its disabled frame by the user's decision until
multiplayer is implemented; nothing is drawn at `mm_t_title`; Quit ends the process on the release with
no confirm, as `MAINMENU.SCRIPT` terminates on `mm_b_quit`; and the top level arrives with no
plaque lit. The pointer is the active bitmap over a live button, a plaque, an edit box and an
open dropdown's rows, the passive one over a roster row, a scrap and dead space, with the hotspot
at the bitmap's top-left; the bitmap swaps on an enter or leave event only, so a pointer already
standing inside a button when a screen is drawn keeps the bitmap it arrived with. Preferences
draws the logo, the panel, the PREFERENCES title, the four doors with all four descriptions
standing at once, CONTROLS live, and RETURN TO MAIN MENU as its only exit, no ACCEPT or CANCEL,
with the movie playing behind it; a leaf's description text stands, following neither the pointer
nor a selection; a dropdown opens under its box and draws only as many rows as it has items; the
Video page stacks ACCEPT over CANCEL, the Keys page draws CANCEL left of ACCEPT, and Escape
inside an armed rebind cell binds Escape. Original takes all four from its own data: the exit
pairs at their authored corners (`VP_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` over `VP_B_CANCELCHANGES` on one column,
`GO_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` left of `GO_B_CANCELCHANGES` on one line, `KB_B_CANCELCHANGES` left of
`KB_B_ACCEPTCHANGES` for whoever builds that page) and an open list one row per item up to the
window its own `D` row authors (`GO_D_DIFFICULTY` 4, `AP_D_SQuality` 4, `VP_D_Device` 4,
`VP_D_Display` 8), past which it windows and scrolls on its own bar as every other list does. The
film cannot speak to that case: the original's leaves carry three tiers and two sound qualities and
never reach a window, while the Resolution row offers a size per mode the screen holds. The rebind
capture is the one deliberate departure: the original writes Escape into an armed cell, CSVM keeps
Escape (and the pad's Back) as the way out of one in both presentations, by the user's decision,
since a keyboard seat must be able to abandon a capture without a controller. The chooser row
is ours, and a disabled door's frame is a state the original never shows. Original reads
the main menu's film too: a press arms the plaque it lands on and draws its held frame, and only
the release still on it activates anything, so a press released elsewhere fires nothing; the
pointer's bitmap is set on an enter or a leave and never recomputed from what a new screen put
under a still pointer; and `CrimFlag.MPG` plays behind the top level and Preferences,
`ExtractRof.ps1` copying the install's loose MPGs in and every leaf still showing it still running
behind the page. Nothing the film shows of Preferences reads differently on Original today.
Still unfilmed: every sound; whether any keyboard or pad focus exists at
all (no take pressed a key outside an edit box, so Original's focus walk stays a remake
equivalence); whether a setting reverts on CANCEL CHANGES (no leaf was re-entered after one);
whether Preferences is reachable in flight; and whether a disabled button ever draws or sounds.

The campaign screens are built from what the layout, the scripts and the briefing dialog evidence:
every `B` row's position and four-frame strip, the `D` rows' boxes, the listbox's window, the
scrapbook rows' region column, the two messagebox button sets and their rows, the roster
sub-script's two colours, the edit box's pre-fill and its two bound wavs, NEXT MISSION disabled
once the campaign is complete, the briefing's narration following its script's start count.
The film (`CAP-52`, silent) shows the campaign screens this way: a campaign plaque (a cabin
button, a briefing plaque, a flight check's paper button) carries the same three lettering states
a main-menu plaque does and fires on the release; a roster row, a contents row and a scrap show no
rollover art; the passive pointer stands over a roster row and a scrap and the active one over
the name box; the profile screen's name box shows a blinking red caret and takes non-ASCII
letters; the sell confirm is the two-button box reading Yes left and No right, the refusal the
one-button OK, and neither draws a focus; and every Back-shaped button lands on the screen that
opened it. Still unfilmed: which sound plays on a plaque, a row or a scrap, and what the edit
box's keystroke and reject sounds are attached to (Original plays `MOUSEOVER` and `MOUSECLICK` on
a plaque, nothing on a row or a scrap, `ENTERTEXT` per taken character and `ENTERTEXT_ERROR` per
refused one); whether REPLAY BRIEFING restarts the narration from its start (never pressed;
Original begins the wav again) and whether leaving the briefing cuts the voice (Original ends it
and lifts the music duck); whether a mission's end starts any narration on the book (Original
starts none); whether a scrap whose region column reads `0,0,0,0` is clickable on its picture
(Original hit-tests the picture's bounds); the delete confirm (never pressed; Original focuses
Yes); and whether any keyboard or pad focus exists on these screens at all and where Back lands
it (Original keeps the focus on the plaque that opened what is being left, a remake equivalence).

The Instant Action screen is built from what the layout and the script evidence: the widgets at
their authored positions over `IA_BackGround`, the contents list's 14-row window with its own
`UpArrow`/`DownArrow`/`Slider` art in the gutter the background paints for it (a dark bar over
x 336 to 354 and y 173 to 428, inside `IA_TL_Contents`' own X 76 plus Width 277, so the 16-pixel
scroll art stands at 337 and the rows stop there), the `Slider` tile drawn stretched to the share of
the list that window shows rather than at its own 11 pixels (the film's opening frame fills the
track from its head at board y 186 down to y 356, which is 14 of the 19 presets over the 230-pixel
track between the arrows), a dropdown's box `Width` wide and `ItemHeight`
high showing its picked value with the `DropDown` arrow strip, the enemy rows on two pages keyed off `IA_B_UP`/
`IA_B_DOWN` (the script's mailbox 20002), the ace duel blanking every enemy dropdown in place (the
script's `0 == WT` branch deactivates them), the wingman plane blanking at zero wingmen, a changed
militia resetting its aircraft (`AV[BA].QG = 0`), stunt flying clearing the clouds
(`FUN_004103b0`'s mask), a contents row applying its preset on select (callback 2302) and View
Story writing the preset's name as the
story title (the `IDS_IA_STORYTITLE` format). The film (`CAP-50`, silent) shows the screen this
way: the contents list and the dropdown half show together on one background; the screen opens on
preset 0 with its row selected and every field reading that preset, not on stored defaults; a
rollover previews nothing, a hover highlight tracking the pointer beside the selected row; a
selected row rewrites the whole right page at once, the preset's name under HEY PILOT! included,
so VIEW STORY writes nothing new there (VIEW STORY itself was never pressed); a changed militia
resets its aircraft to the militia's first; a dropdown opens flush under its box at the box's
width with the current value and the hovered row both highlighted, draws only as many rows as it
has items, and scrolls with its own bar once the list outgrows the authored window (the
pilot-plane list at 21 entries in a 20-row window), that bar standing INSIDE the panel's right
edge with the row bands stopping short of it; a closed box lightens under the pointer; the
ace duel empties the four enemy boxes in place with pale arrows and keeps "[continued ...]" and
the down button live; at zero wingmen the wingman-plane box blanks while the Wingmen count stays
live and the radio pair draws exactly as it does with wingmen set, its Wingmen label as dark as
the Pilot one; the up/down buttons replace the whole right page with the three later waves under
"[go back ...]", a zero-count wave's boxes blanked; BUILD CUSTOM PLANE opens the plane-name
dialog and WEAPON LOADOUT opens AMMO SELECTION for
whichever of Pilot or Wingmen the radio holds, both live; and FLY MISSION opens a loading spread
titled by the mission type. Original draws each of those states, BUILD CUSTOM PLANE and WEAPON
LOADOUT live among them; the list's paper, the band under its picked row, the lighter band under
the row the pointer is on and the cream a closed box's outline takes under the pointer are measured
off the film, no layout row authoring any of them. It opens the page and names the preset
differently by the user's decision, a deliberate departure recorded here, not a defect. Still
unfilmed: VIEW STORY; whether keyboard or pad input reaches the screen at all (Original walks the
widgets in two columns and steps a dropdown's value sideways, a remake equivalence); and every
sound.

The plane-construction screens are built from what the layout and the stills evidence: the
`[@PlaneConstruction@]` chrome and the six tab sections at their authored positions over
`PX_BackGround`, the seven `0x1100` edges as a tab bar (every tab a sibling, `PX_B_Ready` to
Purchase), the `PX_Tab` strip's four frames and its `ColorDisabled`/`ColorActive` label tail, a
dropdown's box `Width` wide and `ItemHeight` high with `TotalDisplayed` as its window and its
`DropUp`/`DropDown` arrows, the `PX_ICON_<airframe>_<pattern>_0..3` layers as the plate and three
region masks (the paint composite the stills show), `PT_P_DECALS`' fifty frames as the decal
tiles, the cabin's `PC_B_PLANEX` edge to `PlaneName` first, the `PN_B_DEFAULT` box authored
checked, langui 203 as the name screen's refusal and 206 as the airframe-switch ask, and the
economy and paint tables (`hangar.md`). The film (`CAP-50` from Instant Action's door, `CAP-52`
from the cabin's, both silent) shows the hub this way: the name screen is a dialog over the
blueprint page with Load Default Configuration drawn checked, and checked it opened on a Balmoral
from Instant Action and a Bloodhawk from the cabin, both complete stock builds, which the decode
settles as the stock build of whichever plane was current at the door (`hangar.md`, "What Load
Default Configuration loads"); the standing tab draws raised and pale
with dark lettering, the other five purple with white, and nothing is gated; all six write their
label on one baseline eight pixels clear of the strip's bottom edge, measured over the six tabs of
`OriginalScreenshots/CustomPlane Armor.png`, which is where the squat frames' plaque stands (the
`PX_Tab.png` frame is 36 pixels tall and its rest and rollover frames are opaque over the bottom
twenty rows alone); the running total is
the PLANE COST line on the page's top rail beside the plane name, following every pick; a
dropdown lists flush under its box, the airframe list at eleven rows with no bar, and the decal
picker is a five-wide thumbnail grid with its own arrows; the Instant Action door wears READY TO
EXPORT and CANCEL EXPORT with a `$$$ on $50000` scrap on every tab, the cabin door READY TO
PURCHASE and CANCEL PURCHASE with `$$$ on $16780`; SELL PLANES opens the `[@Hangar@]` INVENTORY
with a plane dropdown, Sell and Export both drawn live, a value block and DONE back to the tab,
where selling asks with the Yes/No box and a plane that cannot be sold refuses with the OK box;
no airframe switch raised string 206 on a fresh build, which the decode settles as the rule rather
than the take's luck (`hangar.md`, "When the airframe swap asks"); CANCEL drops every pick; and the
weight line turns red over capacity. Original draws all of that, the weight line's red included,
with the cost line reddening on the same script's other arm past the wallet, and the swap's
question as the script's own three-button box. Still
unfilmed: tabs visited out of order (both walks ran 1 to 6); Purchase and whether leaving a tab
commits (Original commits only on `PUR_B_PURCHASE`); the cleared default box (Original starts on
a bare airframe); string 203; and whether keyboard or pad input reaches the hub at all
(Original walks the page's rows then the tab bar and steps a dropdown's value sideways, a remake
equivalence).
- **Built-in's Chapter screen is ours.** The original picks a map through Instant Action's
  environment dropdown; there is no standalone chapter list.
- **The original's plane construction is a tab bar; Built-in's is a linear nine-screen walk.**
- **The cabin's Plane Construction button goes to `PlaneName` first.**
- **Built-in is not asset-independent today.** The milestone's first bullet says Built-in requires no
  extracted menu artwork, and the hangar already loads `extracted/rof/ASSETS/GRAPHICS/PX_<n>_BLUEPRINT.TGA`
  while every campaign screen is a composed board over `extracted/rof/ASSETS/GRAPHICS` and
  `extracted/rimage`. Both degrade rather than fail, so the accurate claim is that Built-in stays
  *usable* without the artwork, not that it does not use it. A3's fallback wording depends on which
  of the two the milestone means.
- **Built-in plays no menu sounds.** The original has four UI wavs plus the splash track.
- **Built-in's mouse reaches its own rows only.** The centred layout's rows are `Control`s that take
  Godot's hit test, so a hover focuses a row, the left button confirms it, the wheel steps a list and
  the right button is Back; the campaign boards under Built-in are one composed surface and stay on
  the keys and pads. The original's layout gives every button a rollover and a depressed colour and
  its listboxes frame the row under the pointer.

## The decoded layout

`ExtractRof.ps1` emits `extracted/rof/menu_layout.json`: the 34 sections bound to their scripts,
both macro mechanisms resolved, every type's field order, the 46 `ScriptToExe` edges, the button
colour tail and frame counts, the `ResID` → `RESOURCE.H` → string join with the symbol kept beside
the text, each screen's script-created keys, the art the scripts name outside the layout,
`SCRAPBOOK.CSV`, and the patch overlay's precedence.
[`formats/menu-layout.md`](../formats/menu-layout.md) is the description of record for all of it,
including what stays ambiguous. Four readings this page carried before that decode were wrong and
are corrected above and here:

- **No macro in the shipped file is unresolved.** `<GX>`, `<Y>`, `<V2>`, `<V3>` and `<V4>` are
  ordinary per-section `V<n>` definitions, and their values agree with
  [`campaign-board.md`](campaign-board.md)'s screenshot measurements to within a pixel.
- **`ScriptPri` takes `0x1000`, `0x1020` and `0x1100`.** There is no `0x1fff` anywhere in the file;
  `0x1100` is exactly the seven `PlaneConstruction` tab-bar edges.
- **149 of the 152 `IDS_*` symbols resolve**, not 148. `RESOURCE.H` aliases three ids to two
  symbols each and `ui_strings.json` keeps only one symbol per id, so a join through that field
  loses `IDS_IA_CONTINUED`; joining through `RESOURCE.H` resolves it. The three that genuinely do
  not resolve are `IDS_GN_1P/2P/3P`, which `RESOURCE.H` does not define.
- **The layout names 124 art files, not 122.** The two the earlier count missed are the volume
  slider's own `PF_B_SliderSlot.png` and `PF_B_Slider.png` on the four `Z` rows.

⚠ **`ZOOMPOINTER.PNG` and `FONT.TGA` are named by neither the layout nor any script.** Part 3 lists
them among the script-named assets; the scripts name `ACTIVEPOINTERZ.PNG`, `PASSIVEPOINTERZ.PNG`
and `ARIAL8.TGA` only. Both files ship, so something names them, but it is not the shipped data:
E42 must treat them as chosen by us until a reader is found.

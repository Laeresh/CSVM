# The command map: keybindings, devices and dispatch, decoded from `crimson.exe`

Read out of the retail executable with Ghidra (static analysis of the shipped x86 build,
`crimson.exe`, `language x86:LE:32:default`), 2026-09-02. Every claim below names the function or
address it came from.

Everything here is a description of *behaviour*. No decompiler output is reproduced; the addresses
are given so any claim can be re-checked at source.

⚠ **This page is a decode, not a proposal.** The original's binding model is narrower than anything
CSVM can ship (one joystick, ten buttons, no axes). Where this page describes a limit, it is
recording what the original does, not setting a bar for the port. See "What this means for CSVM".

**Where the neighbours live.** The eleven targeting actions this page lists by id are decoded as
*behaviour* in [`targeting.md`](targeting.md). The camera actions (`0x30`-`0x39`) are
[`cameraViews.md`](cameraViews.md). The bindings CSVM ships today are `../controls.md`, whose
flight table is the shipped defaults below, key for key, with this port's own actions on the keys
the original leaves free.

## The headline

There is **no default keymap table in the data**. The 64 shipped defaults are emitted by code, one
call each, and the live map is a flat array of **one 32-bit word per command id**, indexed by that
id. Each word packs four binding slots: two keyboard codes, one joystick button, one mouse button.
Any of the four fires the action.

Three findings will not be guessed from the keybind screens:

- **The UI's two columns are not two fields.** The record has four slots, and the row renderer packs
  the first two non-empty of them into the two visible columns. A row showing "E" and "Joystick 3"
  is slot A and the joystick field, with slot B empty.
- **A joystick binding is a bare button index with no device.** There is one joystick pointer in the
  whole program, and axes and hats cannot be bound at all.
- **The keymap persists to the registry, byte for byte.** The saved blob is the in-memory array,
  2400 bytes, not a serialized or textual form.

## Function map

| Address | Role |

## The record

The live map is an array at `inputMgr + 8`, allocated by `FUN_00536f50` as 600 dwords (`0x258`
commands, 2400 bytes). The manager object is `DAT_0075caf4` (read at `0x00537bfa`), size `0x3f5c`,
created by `FUN_00537890` from `0x004a7340`. Parallel arrays in the same object hold the handler
pointers (`+0x10`), the action name strings (`+0x14`, `char[0x50]` each) and the count (`+0x04`).

One command is one 32-bit word. From the encoder `FUN_00537090` and its four accessors:

| Bits | Field | Accessor |
|---|---|---|
| 0-10 | Keyboard binding A, an 11-bit control code | `FUN_005370f0` |
| 11-21 | Keyboard binding B, same encoding | `FUN_00537110` |
| 22-25 | Joystick button, 1-10, 0 meaning unbound | `FUN_00537130` |
| 26-27 | Mouse button, 1-3, 0 meaning unbound | `FUN_00537150` |
| 28-31 | Unused | |

### The keyboard control code

A control code is a **raw DirectInput DIK scancode** in bits 0-7, OR'd with modifier flags
`0x100` Alt, `0x200` Ctrl, `0x400` Shift (`FUN_005357b0`, whose source path is
`D:\zipper\gamez\zinput\zin_kbd.c`; the name formatter is `FUN_005375f0`). It is not a virtual-key
code, so a binding is a physical key position and prints differently under a different layout.

Left and right modifier variants collapse onto the same flag: `0x1d`/`0x9d` Ctrl, `0x2a`/`0x36`
Shift, `0x38`/`0xb8` Alt.

Worked examples from the shipped defaults: `E` is `0x012`, `Shift+E` is `0x412`, `Ctrl+E` is
`0x212`, `Ctrl+X` is `0x22d`, `Shift+L` is `0x426`.

The code space is 2014 values (`0..0x7dd`), gated at `FUN_00535a00` and matching the 2014-entry
tables cleared by `FUN_00536e80` and `FUN_00535fe0`.

### The joystick and mouse fields

A joystick binding is **a button index alone**. `FUN_00536c40` reads the current and previous
`rgbButtons[n-1]` of a single `DIJOYSTATE2` at `DAT_0075c1e4` (0x110 bytes, previous frame's copy at
`DAT_0075c2f4`, filled by `GetDeviceState` in `FUN_00536b50`). The index is gated `1 <= n < 0xb`, so
ten buttons are bindable; `FUN_00536cb0` clears exactly `1..0xa` and `FUN_00537910` fills the name
table over the same range as localized `MSG_JBTN_%d` with a `"Button %d"` fallback.

A mouse binding is a third encoding: the 2-bit field indexes `DAT_0075ccc0 + 0x30/+0x34/+0x38`
(`FUN_00537530`), named Left, Right and Middle by `FUN_005379b0`.

## What the keybind screen shows

`FUN_00449fc0` emits up to four strings for a row, in slot order: keyboard A (`FUN_00537c30` into
`FUN_005375f0`), keyboard B (the same formatter), joystick (`FUN_00537c50` into `FUN_00537830`),
mouse (`FUN_00537c70` into `FUN_005379b0`). Empty slots are skipped and the survivors pack into the
visible columns. So the screen's "Control A" and "Control B" headings name positions in the row, not
fields in the record, and a row reading "E / Joystick 3" has slot B empty.

## The shipped defaults

64 rows, from `FUN_004936c0`. `FUN_00493630` also stores each command's message id into the global
array at `0x0071c5b8` (write at `0x00493697`). Names are resolved by message id through
`language.dll`; the English text is not in `crimson.exe` and is quoted here from the extracted
message table. Control codes are the raw stored values.

⚠ **The clockwise and counterclockwise names are inverted against the message keys.** "Cycle guns
clockwise" is `MSG_CMD_CANNON_PREV` and "counterclockwise" is `MSG_CMD_CANNON_NEXT`. Take the
displayed name, not the key, when reading a direction off this table.

⚠ **The joystick column carries only the counterclockwise half of each weapon cycle**, button 7 for
the guns and button 8 for the rockets. A pad player of the original steps one way and reaches the
other by going round, which is why a second pad control was never a given here.

⚠ **Three codes differ on Japanese hardware.** `FUN_00493630` remaps A and B through
`FUN_00493600` when `FUN_005384a0` returns 1-98, which happens only when `GetKeyboardType(0) == 7`.
On that path `0x0d` becomes `0x90`, `0x29` becomes `0x7d` and `0x429` becomes `0x47d`. Every other
keyboard, German included, gets the literals above.

## Dispatch

Not a scan. The buffered DirectInput keyboard read in `FUN_005357b0` composes
`code = DIK | modifiers` and writes the press or release state straight into
`(&DAT_007582e4)[code * 2]`, with the registered handler for that code at `(&DAT_007582e8)[code * 2]`.
Lookup is a direct index by control code.

`FUN_00536e80` maintains the inverse direction as four arrays inside the manager, one per slot
(`+0x18` keyboard A, `+0x1f90` keyboard B, `+0x3f08` joystick, `+0x3f48` mouse), each mapping a code
to a command id and rebuilt whenever the map changes.

Two consequences:

- **An action holds up to four bindings and any of them fires it.** `FUN_00537530` ORs all four
  slots.
- **Two actions cannot share a code.** `FUN_005371d0` and `FUN_00537230` clear a code out of its
  previous owner's word when it is reassigned, and `FUN_00535fb0` refuses a second handler
  registration for a claimed code, returning `0xffffffff`. The reverse arrays are single-valued, so
  the last write wins.

## Persistence

The map is saved to the **registry**, not to a file. `FUN_005bde90` registers it as name `"CmdMap"`,
type 7, size 2400, scope flag 1. `FUN_005bdc89` saves and `FUN_005bdad1` loads; flag 1 selects
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER` and flag 0 `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`. `FUN_005bd900` builds the path from
`"SOFTWARE\%s\%s\%s"` (literal at `0x0061f0d0`), giving
`SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Games\Crimson Skies\1.0`.

Type 7 writes a `REG_BINARY` of the raw buffer, and `FUN_00536f50` points `inputMgr + 8` at that
same buffer, so **the persisted form is the in-memory array**: 2400 bytes, 600 little-endian dwords
in the layout above, indexed by command id. There is no versioning, no key names and no textual
form.

Startup order is `FUN_0043fb50`: register the variables, run `FUN_004936c0` to lay down the
defaults, load from the registry over the top, then rebuild the reverse arrays.

## What this means for CSVM

| | Original | CSVM today |
|---|---|---|
| Binding identity | a physical scancode plus three modifier bits, or a bare button index | a device identity plus a tagged control (`Binding`); a key control carries the same three modifier bits, so `E` and Shift+`E` are two controls |
| Slots per action | four, fixed by type: keyboard, keyboard, joystick button, mouse button | a list of any length, ORed together (`BindingSet`) |
| Joystick devices | exactly one, `DAT_0075c1e0`, with no index in the record | any number, named by stable hardware string and resolved to a live index per tick |
| Bindable joystick controls | buttons 1-10 only. Axes and hats are read outside the map and cannot be bound | every button the platform reports and either half of any axis; no hat, since a d-pad arrives as buttons |
| Rebinding | a keybind screen writing into the same word the defaults wrote | a screen editing an `ActionMap`, the steal rule naming every action that loses the control |
| Persistence | 2400 raw bytes under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` | versioned JSON per player under `user://`, in the shape below |

Two things are worth taking. The **four-slots-ORed-together** semantics give an action several
bindings at once without a mode, and the **code-uniqueness rule** (reassigning a control steals it
from its previous owner rather than double-binding) is the behaviour a rebinding UI needs anyway.

The encoding is not worth taking. A binding here is a fixed slot of a fixed type on the one device
the program can see, which is why axes are unbindable and why ten buttons is a hard number rather
than a configured one. Wanting more than one pad, an axis driving a digital action, or a device that
survives a replug is what makes a binding a device identity plus a tagged control rather than a
scancode, held in a list rather than in typed slots.

## The CSVM keymap file

One JSON file per player under `user://`, named `bindings_p<n>.json`, written atomically through a
sibling temp file and a rename. It is versioned, and the version says how the tokens below are
encoded rather than which actions exist: an action a file does not name simply stays at its shipped
default, so adding one needs no bump.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "player": 1,
  "mouseFlying": false,
  "contexts": {
    "flight": {
      "FireGuns": ["keyboard/key:Space", "pad:*/button:B"],
      "PitchUp": ["pad:*/axis:LeftY+@0.25"],
      "TargetPreviousEnemy": ["keyboard/key:Shift+E"],
      "TargetNextAlly": []
    },
    "menu": { },
    "camera": { }
  }
}
```

A binding is one string, `device/control`, in words rather than numbers so a player can correct a
row by hand.

- The device is `keyboard`, `mouse`, or `pad:<hardware id>`. A shipped pad row is authored on the
  placeholder id `*`, which the loader replaces with the seat's own pad.
- The control is `key:<name>`, `button:<name>`, `mouse:<name>`, `axis:<name><sign>@<deadzone>` or
  `hat:<index>:<direction>`. A name is the engine's own enum name, or `#<number>` for a code the
  engine does not name; a bare number is accepted on the way back in either way. An axis carries its
  sign and its deadzone, which is both the noise gate and the digital threshold.
- A key name may carry the original's own modifiers in front of it, `key:Shift+E`, `key:Ctrl+E`,
  any of `Shift`, `Ctrl` and `Alt` in any order and any case. That prefix is version 2 of the file;
  a version 1 file names no modifier, and since a bare key token means the same thing in both, such
  a file still loads whole and the reader checks no version.

Every action of every context is written, the ones bound to nothing included, so a deliberate unbind
survives a reload rather than coming back at its default. Whether a seat reads the keyboard is not
written: a saved file could otherwise hand a pad-only splitscreen seat the keyboard back.

`mouseFlying` is the seat's flying scheme, the CONTROLS page's own row (`docs/controls.md`): true
gives the stick the mouse, false leaves it to head-look. It is a scheme rather than a binding, so it
sits beside the contexts instead of in one, and a file that does not name it reads false, which is
why it costs no version bump.

Nothing costs the file. A row the reader cannot read costs that action its saved bindings and
nothing more, leaving it on the shipped default while the rest of the file loads. That covers an
unknown context or action name, a token in a shape this build does not know, and a `hat:` row, which
is deliberately unreadable because Godot reports a d-pad as four buttons and a hat row would be a
second encoding of a control the defaults already author as a button.

## Force feedback

The original drives an Immersion TouchSense stick through `CImmProject`, and every effect it plays
is authored in `CrimsonFF.ifr` (the filename string at `0x00628790`), which ships beside the
executable. The code never builds an effect: it loads thirteen of them by name at startup and then
only starts, stops and rescales them.

`FUN_00480840` is the constructor that opens the file and loads the set. It runs only when
`FUN_00440540()` returns 2 (the force-feedback device class) and `FUN_00536d10()` reports a device,
takes the `IDirectInputDevice2A` from `FUN_00536cf0`, binds it through `CImmDXDevice::Initialize`,
and then makes one `CImmProject::CreateEffect` call per name. Every carrier below asks two questions
before it touches the hardware: `FUN_00480d30()`, the per-call enable predicate, and the byte at
`DAT_0071c298 + 0x91d`, a global suppress flag that shuts the whole system off while it is set.

### The effect slots

Loaded in this order, each into a fixed offset on the manager object. Six of them fall back to a
neighbour when the file does not carry them, and the fallback is what the gain writes further down
exist for.

| Effect | Name string | Slot | Falls back to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FireGun_large` | `0x006287a0` | `+0x148` | none |
| `RocketFire_large` | `0x006287b0` | `+0x158` | none |
| `GunHit` | `0x006287c4` | `+0x160` | none |
| `RocketHit` | `0x006287cc` | `+0x164` | none |
| `Collision_large` | `0x006287d8` | `+0x168` | none |
| `NitroStart` | `0x006287e8` | `+0x170` | none |
| `ExcessiveSpeed` | `0x006287f4` | `+0x184` | none |
| `TurretFire` | `0x00628804` | `+0x190` | `+0x148`, flag `+0x14c` |
| `FireGun_small` | `0x00628810` | `+0x140` | `+0x148`, flag `+0x14c` |
| `FireGun_medium` | `0x00628820` | `+0x144` | `+0x148`, flag `+0x14c` |
| `RocketFire_small` | `0x00628830` | `+0x150` | `+0x158`, flag `+0x15c` |
| `RocketFire_small_rear` | `0x00628844` | `+0x154` | `+0x158`, flag `+0x15c` |
| `Collision_small` | `0x0062885c` | `+0x16c` | `+0x168`, no flag |

The file carries two more effects, `EngineStart` and `EngineStop`, that no `CreateEffect` call names.
They are authored and unreachable.

### The carriers

Thirteen effects, nine routines. Every event the original rumbles for is one of these.

| Routine | Event | Condition, and what it writes |
|---|---|---|
| `FUN_004810d0` | gun fire | The weapon's `CALIBER`: below `0x32` takes `+0x140`, below `0x46` takes `+0x144`, at or above takes `+0x148`. Sets the hold-over `+0x13c` to the clock plus 0.3 s and stops the turret effect if that shares the slot. The gains 0.647, 0.82 and 1.0 are written only on the fallback path. |
| `FUN_00480f50` | ordnance launch | Only for a weapon whose flag word (`**(uint**)(*param_3 + 0x210)`) has `0x10` set. `0x08` (torpedo) takes `+0x158`, else `0x20000` (rear mount) takes `+0x154`, else `+0x150`. The gains 1.0, 0.58 at bearing 180 and 0.79 are fallback-path only. |
| `FUN_00481330` | a gun round taken | Always `+0x160`, with the gain written every time: 0.75 below 6.0 damage, 1.0 at or above. |
| `FUN_004813c0` | any other round taken | Always `+0x164`, gain written every time: 0.8 below 100.0 damage, 1.0 at or above. |
| `FUN_00481450` | a collision | Below 50.5 damage takes `+0x16c`, at or above takes `+0x168`. The gain is 1.0 for both; the 0.85 appears only where `Collision_small` fell back onto `Collision_large`. |
| `FUN_004814f0` | the nitro engaging | `+0x170`, a plain stop and start with no gain written at all. |
| `FUN_00481540` | flight past the rated maximum | `+0x184`, started once and held: sets the hold-over `+0x178` to the clock plus 0.2 s on every tick past the gate. Re-parameterises the gain from its float argument, but only when that has moved more than 0.1 since `+0x17c` and at most once a second (`+0x180`). |
| `FUN_00481640` | the turret gunner firing | `+0x190`, started once and held, hold-over `+0x18c` at the clock plus 0.2 s. The gain 0.515 at bearing 180 is fallback-path only. |
| `FUN_00480d60` | the per-frame tick | Stops each of the three held effects once the clock passes its hold-over, which is what gives the gun, overspeed and turret effects their length. |

### The authored effects

Read out of `CrimsonFF.ifr` itself. `Magnitude` and `AttackLevel` are 0 to 10000, `Duration` is
microseconds, `Direction` is hundredths of a degree.

| Effect | Type | Magnitude | Duration | Direction | Infinite |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FireGun_small` | Periodic | 4400 | 90900 | 0 | yes |
| `FireGun_medium` | Periodic | 5600 | 125000 | 0 | yes |
| `FireGun_large` | Periodic | 9534 | 167000 | 0 | yes |
| `RocketFire_small` | Vector Force | 7500 | 250000 | 0 | no |
| `RocketFire_small_rear` | Vector Force | 5500 | 250000 | 18000 | no |
| `RocketFire_large` | Vector Force | 9371 | 500000 | 0 | no |
| `GunHit` | Vector Force | 8000 | 100000 | 27000 | no |
| `RocketHit` | Compound | push 8500, rumble 6434 | 400000 and 500000 | 27000 and 0 | no |
| `Collision_large` | Compound | pop 10000, rumble 8500 | 800000 and 1000000 | 27000 and 0 | no |
| `Collision_small` | Compound | push 8500, rumble 6434 | 400000 and 500000 | 27000 and 0 | no |
| `NitroStart` | Pop | attack 10000 | 1000000 | 0 | no |
| `ExcessiveSpeed` | Periodic | 4500 | 1000000 | 27000 | yes |
| `TurretFire` | Periodic | 3500 | 1000000 | 18000 | yes |

A compound is a list of child GUIDs, and the code starts the parent. The three infinite effects
carry a `Duration` that never applies; their length at the controls is the hold-over above.

### What CSVM plays

`CSVM/src/Bindings/PadRumble.cs` holds this survey as a table of fifteen rows, one per event the
carriers above distinguish. The mapping to a two-motor pad is mechanical: a `Periodic` child drives
the weak motor and a `Vector Force` or `Pop` child the strong one, which is the nearest a pad comes
to hardware that took a bearing. A magnitude is the authored one over 10000, except where the code
writes a gain on every call (the two hit routines and the collision routine), where the gain is the
number. A length is the authored `Duration`, except on the three infinite effects, where it is the
hold-over `FUN_00480d60` stops them after.

⚠ **Direction is dropped, not folded in.** Seven of the thirteen effects aim along a bearing to what
caused them. A pad has two motors and nothing to aim, so the bearing is discarded rather than turned
into a left/right split, which would be a different cue rather than a smaller one.

The fallback gains are not reproduced. They exist so a file missing an effect still rumbles with a
rescaled neighbour, and CSVM's table has a row for every event already.

### The one quantity not pinned

`FUN_00481540` rewrites the overspeed effect's gain from a float its caller hands it, rate-limited to
once a second. That float is a speed ratio, but the scale it is expressed on was not established, so
CSVM plays the effect at its authored 4500 throughout a dive instead of tracking the ratio. The cue
is there and its strength is the original's; what a deeper dive adds to it is not.

## Open questions

- The `key_*` string table at `0x0060cdcc`-`0x0060d30f`, with a 120-entry pointer array at
  `0x00640708`, is the GOSSCRIPT console's key-name constants and has no visible xrefs. It is not
  the command map and its parallel value array was not chased.
- Commands are 600 slots wide but only 64 ids are defined, sparsely, up to `0x6f`. Whether the gaps
  are cut features, debug commands or slots for another build was not investigated.

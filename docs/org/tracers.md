# Projectile visuals and tracers, decoded from `crimson.exe`

Read out of the retail executable with Ghidra (static analysis of the shipped x86 build,
`crimson.exe`, `language x86:LE:32:default`), 2026-08-10. Every claim below names the function it
came from, or the extracted gamez record it was read from.

Everything here is a description of *behaviour and geometry*. No decompiler output is reproduced;
the addresses are given so any claim can be re-checked at source.

**Where the other halves live.** The authored side, the `FIRE`/`FLYOUT`/`IMPACT` bindings, the
prototype-root table, the per-ammo texture axis, is [`formats/weapons.md`](../formats/weapons.md)
and [`formats/weapon-effects.md`](../formats/weapon-effects.md), which name the tracer textures but
say nothing about how they are drawn. Our implementation is `CSVM/src/Flight/Projectile.cs`. This
page is the original's runtime: what the engine does with the `FLYOUT MODEL` a weapon names.

⚠ **This page is a decode, not a proposal.** Where it disagrees with a footage measurement, the
decode wins and the disagreement is a note (see
[`video-measurements-unreliable`](../../backlog.md)'s worked case). Where CSVM deliberately differs, that is listed at the bottom rather than hidden.

**The headline: there is no tracer code.** No string, symbol or branch in the executable mentions a
tracer. A tracer is a piece of *authored geometry*, a 4.5 m crossed-quad streak inside the round's
`FLYOUT MODEL`, that the weapon module aims once at spawn and thereafter only translates.

## Function map

All in `D:\zipper\gamez\zweapon\` unless noted.

| Address | Role |
|---|---|
| `FUN_005ad630` | ZWEP `BALLISTICS` reader (`zwep_init.c`), parses every weapon key into the 0x214-byte def, and sets the billboard flag below |
| `FUN_005ae990` | The `FIRE`/`FLYOUT`/`IMPACT` binding-block parser, `MODEL`, `EFFECT`, `ANIMATION`, `MODEL_ANIMATION`, `SURFACE_ANIMATION`, `SOUND` |
| `FUN_005aeca0` | Projectile pool alloc, attaches the flyout model to the round's node |
| `FUN_005aef40` | Fire/spawn, places the round and applies its **one and only** orientation |
| `FUN_005af900` | Per-frame projectile pass over the live list |
| `FUN_005af720` | The integrator: one pass over the live list, moving and colliding each round |
| `FUN_005afd50` | Moves one round, accumulates its flown distance, and ends it at `RANGE` |
| `FUN_005ac3a0` | The end-of-flight detonation: the impact/blast handler at the round's last position |
| `FUN_005b0770` | Per-frame visual update of one live round, position, and conditional re-orientation |
| `FUN_005aed40` | Despawn, detaches the model, resets the node's scale/rotation/position |
| `FUN_005ad290` | Hands out a per-round *clone* of the flyout model (only for `MODEL_ANIMATION` carriers) |
| `FUN_005b0cb0` | The `INSTANT`/`MULTI_TARGET` beam renderer, **dead in this install**, see below |
| `FUN_004d8eb0` / `LAB_004d8e90` | `zclass/Object3d.c`: subtree predicate + the "is a plain camera-facing facade" test |
| `FUN_004cd610` | `zclass/Class.c` add-child, the multi-parent attach that makes model sharing work |
| `FUN_004d1a30` / `FUN_004d1d50` / `FUN_004d18d0` | Object3d set rotation / position / scale |

Weapon-def offsets used below: `+0x120` = `FLYOUT`'s `MODEL` node, `+0x110` = `FLYOUT`'s
`MODEL_ANIMATION`, `+0x54` = `GRAVITY`, `+0x74` = the flag word.

## The billboard flag, bit 9 of the def flag word

At parse time (`FUN_005ad630`, in the `FLYOUT`/`PROJECTILE_BBOX` block) the reader walks the whole
flyout-model subtree with `FUN_004d8eb0` and a predicate at `LAB_004d8e90`. The predicate reads the
node's `+0x3c` block and returns true for `type == 1 && [+4] == 0`, a plain camera-facing facade
with no reference node. The result is **inverted** into bit 9:

> **bit 9 (`0x200`) = "this flyout model contains no billboard".**

That is the whole decision. A model that faces the camera by itself is never rotated by the weapon
code; a model made of fixed geometry is aimed along the shot. Nothing else consults it.

## Spawn, the orientation is applied exactly once

`FUN_005aef40`, after the muzzle effects and before the node is made live:

- if `!(flags & 0x4000)` **and** (`(flags & 0x200)` with a flyout model, or a fire effect with no
  flyout model), the round's node is rotated to `yaw = atan2(-dir.x, -dir.z)`, pitch from the same
  direction vector, i.e. **aimed along the firing vector**;
- then `FUN_004d1d50` places the node at the muzzle point.

The negated `atan2` arguments are the engine stating that a model's local forward is **−Z**, which
is the same convention the prototype geometry is authored in.

No roll is applied. `FIXED_ROTATE` (bit 8) exists to suppress the per-frame update below, not this.

## Attach, one model node, many rounds

`FUN_005aeca0` pops a projectile from the free list and then:

- **no `MODEL_ANIMATION` on `FLYOUT`** (every gun), the *prototype node itself* is attached under
  the pooled projectile node via `FUN_004d1390` → `FUN_004cd610`. No copy is made.
- **`MODEL_ANIMATION` present** (the rockets, for their trail defs), `FUN_005ad290` pops a
  pre-made clone from a per-weapon free list at def `+0x160`, or deep-clones the prototype
  (`FUN_004d85a0`) when that list is empty. Each round then owns its subtree, which is what lets a
  per-round def animate it.

⚠ **The no-copy path is not a bug, and reading it as one gives "only the newest round is visible".**
`FUN_004cd610` pushes the new parent onto the *child's* parent array (`+0x54` count, `+0x58` array)
as well as the child onto the parent's, and calls `FUN_004cf7c0` as soon as a node has more than one
parent. The scene graph is a **DAG**: one shared model node is drawn once per parent path, at each
parent's transform. Every live gun round renders the same `slug.flt` at its own position,
allocating nothing. `PROJECTILE_BBOX` (def `+0x78` bit 0) is applied to the pooled node here, not to
the shared model.

`FUN_005aed40` unwinds it symmetrically on despawn, detach every parent, detach every child, then
reset the node's scale to 1,1,1 and its rotation and position to zero, because the node goes back to
a pool that other weapons will reuse.

## Per frame, a position write, and nothing else

`FUN_005af900` walks the live list and calls `FUN_005b0770` for each round in state 1. That
function re-orients the node from the current velocity **only if**

```
GRAVITY (+0x54) != 0   and   !(flags & 0x100 /* FIXED_ROTATE */)   and   !(flags & 0x4000)
```

Every weapon in this install ships `GRAVITY 0.0` ([`formats/weapons.md`](../formats/weapons.md),
Ballistics: 5 carriers, all zero), so **the branch never runs**: a round's orientation is frozen at
the spawn value for its whole flight, and the per-frame cost is one `FUN_004d1d50` position write.
The re-orientation exists for ballistic drop, which this install never authors.

The `0x4000` branch is the exception that proves it: those rounds are spun about Y at
`3.4906585 rad/s` (200°/s) and scaled `1 → 5` over their first second (`s = 1 + 4t`). Nothing scales
or fades an ordinary round, no per-frame opacity, no distance scaling, no billboarding.

## How a round ends: `RANGE`, and what it leaves behind

Decoded 2026-08-15. The integrator is `FUN_005af720`, which walks the live list and calls
`FUN_005afd50` to move one round. Every frame that move adds the length of the step to a running
total at `round+0x664` and compares the total against the weapon's `RANGE` at `weapon+0x1c`
(`0x005b01e6` onward). While the total is under `RANGE` the round keeps flying; once it reaches
`RANGE` the round's state word at `round+0x20` is cleared, and the next pass of `FUN_005af900`
hands it to the despawn path `FUN_005b08d0`.

What the round leaves behind at that point is decided by a single flag test at `0x005b0206`, and
**nothing on that path queries what the round is flying over.**

- The false arm falls to `LAB_005b0318`, which clears the state word and returns. No raycast, no
  impact row, no sound, no effect. The round is simply gone.
- The true arm publishes the last position into the effect-origin globals (`_DAT_00a1d7a4` onward)
  and calls `FUN_005ac3a0`, which runs the ordinary impact/blast handler `FUN_005ac7a0` at that
  point and, when `weapon+0x3c` is positive, the area pass `FUN_005aca30` / `FUN_005acac0`.

The condition as written is `(LOCK_ON && !EXPIRES) || DETONATE_AT_RANGE`, against three bits of the
def flag word at `weapon+0x74`: bit 15 (`0x8000`) `LOCK_ON`, set at `0x005addd5`; bit 7 (`0x80`)
`EXPIRES`, set at `0x005adca6`; bit 25 (`0x2000000`) `DETONATE_AT_RANGE`, set at `0x005adbf8`.
**Neither `EXPIRES` nor `DETONATE_AT_RANGE` is authored by any of the 48 entries in
`weapons.zrd.json`.**

⚠ **Do not read "which weapons detonate at max range" off bit 15.** Inside this layer both the
max-range detonation and the proximity fuse are gated on `LOCK_ON`, yet `wep_12` CHOKER authors
`DETONATION_DISTANCE 35` and `DETONATION_DOT_PRODUCT 0.1` without `LOCK_ON` and is filmed detonating
in mid-air. Some consumer outside the ZWEP projectile layer therefore also ends these rounds, and it
has not been read (the game-side weapon-extension struct hung off `FUN_004ba6f0`, or the `TANGLER`
handling, are the candidates). Which rocket ends how is an open decode, not a settled table.

Two neighbouring fields, since they are easy to confuse with the range test: `weapon+0x44` is
`DETONATION_DISTANCE` and is stored **squared** (`0x005adbb9`), and `weapon+0x48` is
`DETONATION_TIME` (`0x005adbd6`). Neither key sets a flag bit of its own.

**The default `RANGE` is 500 m** (`MOV dword ptr [EBX+0x1c], 0x43fa0000` at `0x005ad80b`, in the
reader's defaults block). Only `wep_13` SMOKER and `wep_15` FLARE omit the key, and neither appears
to end by range: SMOKER is `REAR` + `SMOKE_SCREEN`, FLARE carries `DETONATION_TIME 2.0`.

**Probe trap.** A round is invisible past the 600 m LOD cut but live and lethal out to `RANGE`, and
past `RANGE` it is gone with no trace at all. A firing probe placed at a slant beyond the weapon's
`RANGE` logs zero impacts and looks exactly like a missing collider. Fire from well inside `RANGE`,
or the instrument manufactures a false negative.

## The dead beam renderer

`FUN_005b0cb0` is a second, much larger per-frame pass over the same live list that renders a shot
as a **chain of stretched segments**: each segment's node is placed at the segment start, aimed
along the ray, and Z-scaled to the segment's length (`FUN_004d18d0(node, 1, 1, len)`), with an
opacity pulse `lerp(min, max, (sin(2π·f·t)+1)/2)` and a per-segment raycast for bounces; a second
branch forks it into randomly-jittered sub-segments at 0.4× each. It is gated on `INSTANT` (bit 11)
and `MULTI_TARGET` (bit 17).

**No weapon in this install sets either flag**, neither key appears anywhere in the 48 weapon
entries. This is MechWarrior-3 laser/PPC code carried into the engine and never reached. Anyone
hunting "how does the engine draw a streak?" will find this function first; it is the wrong answer.

## The authored tracer, `slug.flt` and its three siblings

Read from `extracted/C1/gamez/{nodes,models,materials,textures}.json`. All four ammo prototypes are
structurally identical:

```
slug.flt              root, model_index -1, bbox_child, child_bbox z −4.71 … 0
├─ g11                model 48 — 0 vertices (placeholder)
└─ l5     LOD, range 0 … 600 m
   ├─ g10             model 49 — 8 v / ONE 8-gon poly: a regular octagon disc of
   │                  radius 0.1445 m lying in the XY plane (z = 0), i.e. facing
   │                  ALONG the flight axis, with radial UVs; node transform
   │                  translates it to z −4.5647      → texture slugtip.tif
   └─ rabbit_blur     model 50 — 8 v / 2 polys, both spanning z −4.5 … 0:
                      poly 0 in the y = 0 plane, poly 1 in the x = 0 plane, each
                      0.2 m wide — two PERPENDICULAR quads crossed along the flight
                      axis. show_backface, vertex colours full white, U runs 0 at
                      the front to 1 at the tail   → texture tracer_slug.tif
```

| Prototype | streak model | streak texture | tip texture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `slug.flt` | 50 | `tracer_slug.tif` | `slugtip.tif` |
| `dumdum.flt` | 53 | `tracer_dumdum.tif` | `dumdumtip.tif` |
| `armorpiercing.flt` | 56 | `tracer_armorpierce.tif` | `armourpiercetip.tif` |
| `magnesium.flt` | 59 | `tracer_magnesium.tif` | `magnesiumtip.tif` |

So a tracer is **two perpendicular quads, 0.2 m wide and 4.5 m long**, plus a 0.29 m octagonal disc
just past the leading end. Four things follow, and each is checkable:

- **The crossed pair is why no billboarding code is needed.** Two perpendicular quads read as a
  solid streak from any viewing angle, which is exactly why the subtree contains no facade node and
  therefore why bit 9 is set and the round *is* aimed along the shot.
- **The node position is the streak's TAIL.** Geometry runs from `z = 0` forward to `z = −4.5`
  (−Z is forward), and the tip quad sits at `z = −4.5647`, just past the leading end. The round's
  tracked point trails 4.5 m behind the bright tip the player sees.
- **The bright head is a head-on-only disc.** `g10` is perpendicular to the flight axis, so it
  presents its full 0.29 m face when the round flies toward or away from the viewer and goes
  edge-on, effectively invisible, from the side. A side-on tracer is the crossed streak *alone*;
  the "glowing head" reading only holds for rounds coming at you.
- **The `l5` LOD cuts off at 600 m.** Past that range both the streak and the tip stop drawing and
  all that remains is the zero-vertex `g11`, a round beyond 600 m is **invisible while still live
  and lethal** out to `RANGE` (900–10000 m). The disappearance is authored, not a draw-distance
  artefact.

`tracer1.tif`, the generic fifth texture, is bound by no gun prototype; the four ammo types cover
every gun in the install.

**Rockets carry no streak at all.** `he_rocket` and `ap_rocket` are LOD-wrapped missile *bodies*
(35 v / 8 polys, ~1.5–1.7 m long, on `missile_he`/`missile_ap` + `missil02`/`04`/`05`) with no
`rabbit_blur` sibling and no tip disc. An ordnance round's visible trail is its `MODEL_ANIMATION`
puffer smoke ([`formats/weapon-effects.md`](../formats/weapon-effects.md), "FLYOUT
`MODEL_ANIMATION`"), not a tracer quad. Anything drawing a streak behind a rocket is inventing it.

## Where CSVM differs

`CSVM/src/Flight/Projectile.cs` does not instance the prototype at all: it draws a hand-tuned sprite
per round. The decode settles the numbers that tuning was standing in for.

At the range-expiry branch (`Projectile.cs:897-912`) we agree with the original on the case that
matters at the controls: a gun round dies silently, with no effect and no surface query, so nothing
splashes when it runs out of range over water. Two details differ and are not yet reconciled.

- We split on `weapon.IsRocket`; the original's flag test is the `LOCK_ON` bit, and the two sets are
  not the same (`wep_12` CHOKER, `wep_13` SMOKER and `wep_26` FW are `ROCKET` without `LOCK_ON`,
  `wep_25` is the reverse). Fixing this to `LockOn` alone would be premature while the CHOKER case
  above says the flag is not the whole story.
- Our fallback `RANGE` is `1000f` (`Projectile.cs:711`) against the engine's 500 m. It reaches only
  SMOKER and FLARE, neither of which appears to end by range.

| | Original (measured) | CSVM (`RenderTracers`) | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Streak length | **4.5 m** | `TracerLength` 1.0 m | 4.5× short |
| Streak width | **0.2 m** | `TracerWidth` 0.10 m | 2× narrow |
| Where it sits | tail AT the round's position, geometry runs **forward**; head 4.56 m ahead | quad centred half a length **behind** the position | the drawn streak is on the wrong side of the simulated point, a ~5 m offset in the direction of travel |
| Geometry | **two perpendicular** quads, `show_backface`, fixed | **one** quad, rolled about the velocity axis to face the camera every frame | the original needs no camera at all; ours degenerates when a round flies at the eye |
| Leading head | a **second** mesh: 0.29 m octagonal disc on its own `*tip` texture, perpendicular to flight (head-on only) | none | ours has no head-on element at all |
| Colour | white vertex colours, texture unmodified | `TracerBrightness` ×3 overbright, additive | ours compensates for the missing tip disc and no bloom |
| Growth | full 4.5 m from the spawn frame; nothing ever scales a gun round | length capped by distance travelled, so it grows out of the muzzle | ours is an invention; harmless at 8 shots/s but not the original |
| Range cutoff | LOD **600 m**, then nothing draws | `TracerMinPixels` 2.0 floor *inflates* distant rounds | ⚠ direct conflict, ours deliberately shows what the original hides |
| Who the floor is for | n/a, the LOD is per-viewer, because each pane draws its own | one shared world mesh, floored for the **nearest** bound viewer | the original's per-camera LOD has no equivalent for a shared mesh; sizing for P1 alone was the splitscreen bug |
| Rockets | prototype body only, no streak; the trail is `MODEL_ANIMATION` puffer smoke | a `tracer1` streak at `RocketExhaustScale` 0.5 / `RocketStreakScale` 2.4 | ours invents a streak the data has no counterpart for |
| Per-frame work | one position write per round | per-round basis rebuild against the listener camera | |

**How the floor itself is computed**, since it is the one row above with no original behind it to
check against: `screenPx = worldSize · viewportHeight / (2 · distance · tan(fov/2))`, inverted for
the world size that covers `TracerMinPixels`. It is **linear in distance**, which is exactly why
one shared world mesh cannot satisfy two cameras at once, and each viewer is measured with its
**own pane height**, not the window's. Those two together are the whole splitscreen bug: a round
1000 m from P1 and 100 m from P2, sized for P1, covers ten times its 2 px target in P2's pane. The
rule is therefore the SMALLEST of the viewers' individual floors, and it follows that arithmetic
rather than raw distance ordering, a nearer camera in a quarter-height pane legitimately needs a
larger world size than a farther one in a full-height pane, and wins. A viewer the projection
cannot use (a camera sitting exactly on the round, a pane with no height) is skipped rather than
collapsing the floor to zero for everyone, and no bound viewers at all means **no floor**, falling
through to the authored sizes rather than to zero-size or infinite geometry.

None of these are changed by this page. `TracerMinPixels` in particular was introduced from the
reference captures showing distant fire as visible streaks; the 600 m LOD says the original stops
drawing them, so that reading needs re-checking against a shot fired at a *known* range before
either side is called wrong.

⚠ **The 2.0 px floor was fitted under a wider frustum than the one the external views now draw.**
The formula above takes the live camera's own FOV and so stays correct arithmetic, but the fit that
chose 2.0 was made while every external camera ran a 62° vertical, and the decoded base is 46.8°
(`docs/org/cameraViews.md`, "FOV constants and aspect correction"). A round of a given size at a
given range now covers 1.39× the pixels it did, so the floor engages at a longer range than when
the number was picked. Re-judge what the floor is for against the captures rather than re-solving
2.0 from the same arithmetic.

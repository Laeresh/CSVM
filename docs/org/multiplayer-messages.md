# Multiplayer messages, decoded from `crimson.exe`

Every message the original puts on the wire: its type word, who builds it, who handles it, what
the payload holds, and whether DirectPlay is asked to guarantee it. What the same match counts
and how it ends is [`multiplayer-scoring.md`](multiplayer-scoring.md); where it puts a pilot is
[`multiplayer-spawn.md`](multiplayer-spawn.md).

The match half lives in `remote.cpp` (the source path string at `00628f50`) and the lobby half in
the `00413xxx` block; the DirectPlay wrapper under them is the `005b2xxx`/`005b4xxx` block.

## The framing is two words

Every packet opens with a 16-bit type at `+0` and a 16-bit total length, header included, at
`+2`. Nothing else is common: there is no sequence number, no checksum and no sender id in the
frame, because DirectPlay hands the handler the sender's player id as its own argument.

`FUN_005b4850(fromId, packet)` is the dispatcher. It walks the handler list headed at
`DAT_009c7874` and calls **every** entry whose registered type word equals the packet's first
word (`005b4851`…`005b4874`). A type with no entry is dropped without a word, and two entries for
one type both run. `FUN_005b4720(type, handler, 2)` adds one, `FUN_005b47a0(type, handler)`
removes it.

`FUN_00495310` registers the whole match set at session init and `FUN_004966c0` removes exactly
the same set at teardown, which is why a type that is live in a match is dead in the menus.

## The send call, and what "guaranteed" means here

`FUN_005b2640(data, size, guaranteed, toPlayer)` is the only send in the program. It builds the
flag word as `(guaranteed != 0)`, which is `DPSEND_GUARANTEED`, and adds `DPSEND_ASYNC` (`0x200`)
when `DAT_009c7869` is set, then calls `IDirectPlay4::SendEx` through vtable slot `+0xc4`.
`toPlayer` of 0 is `DPID_ALLPLAYERS`, so a 0 in the table below is a broadcast.

`DAT_009c7869` is read out of the session caps in `FUN_005b4930`: the flag is the caps bit
`0x10000`, and when it is clear the program puts up a "NOT Using Asynchronous Sends" message box
and sends synchronously. So asynchrony is a service-provider property, not a per-message choice;
the guarantee is the per-message choice, and it is what the remake's reliability classes model.

## The match message table

Sizes are the total the builder writes into the length word. "Guar." is the third argument at the
send call, and "To" is the fourth.

| Type | Builder | Handler | Bytes | Guar. | To | What it carries |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0d` | none | `LAB_00496ca0` | 4 | n/a | n/a | a peer left, synthesised locally (see below) |
| `0x0e` | none | `LAB_004978f0` | 4 | n/a | n/a | a peer arrived, synthesised locally |
| `0x0f` | `FUN_00496ee0` | `FUN_00497950` | `0x20` + `0xc` per hit, `0x2c` when a shot rides along | **no** | one peer | the aircraft state, below |
| `0x0f` | `FUN_004975d0` | `FUN_00497950` | `0x20` | yes | 0 | the same shape sent once at spawn, which is the one guaranteed state packet |
| `0x10` | `FUN_004988e0` | `LAB_00498950` | `0x1c` | yes | 0 | a weapon event: a word at `+4`, the two dwords at aircraft `+0x728`/`+0x72c`, and a three-float vector from `+0x294` |
| `0x11` | `FUN_0049bc00` | `LAB_0049bc80` | 4 + payload | yes | 0 | a console or log line relayed to every peer, gated on `DAT_0071d23d` |
| `0x12` | `FUN_00498a90` | `FUN_00498bf0` | `0x10` | yes | 0 | the death report, below |
| `0x13` | `FUN_00499270` | `FUN_004993f0` | `0xc` + 8 per row | yes | 0 | the whole score table: player count at `+4`, team count at `+8`, then one `(id, score)` pair per row |
| `0x14` | `FUN_00499490` | `FUN_00499530` | `0x10` | yes | 0 | the career counters: kills at `+4`, deaths at `+6`, then two dwords from `0071d2fc`/`0071d300` |
| `0x15` | `FUN_00499a50` | `LAB_00499b30` | 6 + text | see note | 0 or one peer | chat. An all-chat goes out **unguaranteed** to everybody; a team chat is sent guaranteed, once per teammate, to each peer whose `+0x18` matches the sender's team slot |
| `0x17` | `FUN_004996d0` | `FUN_00499730` | `0xc` | yes | 0 | the match end: a float clock at `+4` and the reason at `+8` |
| `0x18` | `FUN_00413170` | lobby | `0x18` + text | mode-dependent | 0, one peer, or each peer | a lobby notice with a string; the third argument selects broadcast, per-team or single |
| `0x1a` | `FUN_00413090`, `FUN_00413f70`, `FUN_004142c0`, `FUN_00414340`, `FUN_004143c0` | lobby | `0xc`, or 4 + payload from the last | yes | 0 | a lobby setting change; the subtype word at `+4` is 8, 8, 2, 1 and variable in builder order |
| `0x1c` | `FUN_0049a050` | `FUN_0049a170` | `0xc` | yes | the host (`DAT_0071d228`) | an objective or flag request, which only the host answers |
| `0x1d` | `FUN_0049a240` | `FUN_0049a300` | 8 + `0xc` per row | yes | 0 | the objective table: a count at `+4`, then `(id, holder, state)` per row |
| `0x1e` | `FUN_0049adf0` | `FUN_0049b0b0` | 6 + `0x1c` per zeppelin + `0x10` per event | **no** | 0 | the zeppelin state, below |
| `0x1f` | `FUN_0049b320` | `FUN_0049b3e0` | `0xc` | yes | 0 | a turret or part event raised by the local aircraft, packed as `part & 3 \| (kind & 7) << 2` at `+4` and an owner id at `+8` |
| `0x20` | `FUN_0049b210` | `FUN_0049b2c0` | `0xc` | yes | 0 | the same shape raised for a remote owner |
| `0x21` | none found | `LAB_004990d0` | | | | receive-only in this build |
| `0x22` | `FUN_00499110` | `LAB_00499190` | `0x10` | yes | 0 | a damage attribution: victim id at `+4`, attacker id at `+8`, a dword from the weapon record `+0x10` at `+0xc` |
| `0x23` | `FUN_0049bd00` | `LAB_0049bd70` | `0xc` | yes | one peer | the ping: two `GetTickCount` stamps, sent only to a peer whose id is at or above ours, so one side of each pair pings |
| `0x24`, `0x25` | none found | `LAB_0049bde0` | | | | receive-only in this build, both on one handler |
| `0x26` | `FUN_004134e0` | lobby, `FUN_00415940` | `0x30` + the packed outlaw list | **no** | 0 | the lobby settings block, below |
| `0x27` | `FUN_004135f0` | lobby | 8 + `0x20` per player + a tail | yes | 0 | the lobby roster, below |

⚠ **Types `0x02`, `0x03`, `0x05`, `0x06`, `0x07`, `0x0d` and `0x0e` never cross the wire.**
`FUN_005b2820` and `FUN_005b24a0` build them on the stack from DirectPlay's own system messages
and hand them straight to the dispatcher (the type and length pairs are written as immediates at
`005b2898`, `005b29ad`, `005b29db`, `005b2aa8`, `005b2ad0`, `005b2ad9` and `005b2618`). They are
4 or 8 bytes and they are local notifications, so a remake has no counterpart to serialise: the
transport's own connect and disconnect callbacks are the counterpart.

## The aircraft state packet

`FUN_00496ee0(force)` walks the remote list and sends one packet **per peer**, unguaranteed:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | type `0x0f`, then the total length |
| `+0x04`, `+0x08`, `+0x0c` | position, three dwords straight off the aircraft at `+0x204` |
| `+0x10` | orientation, three angles packed into one dword as `yaw << 0x15 \| pitch << 0xb \| roll` |
| `+0x14` | motion, packed the same way as `a << 0x14 \| b << 10 \| c` |
| `+0x18` | `GetTickCount` at build time |
| `+0x1c` | throttle in the low byte, a 7-bit field at bits 8..14, and one flag at bit 15 |
| `+0x1e` | a 3-bit shot count at bits 4..6 and a 4-bit hit count at bits 0..3 |
| `+0x20` | when the shot count is above zero, three dwords of shot state |
| tail | the queued hit records, 12 bytes each |

⚠ **The original batches its hit reports onto this unguaranteed packet.** A hit is queued by
`FUN_004987d0` as a 12-byte record onto the list at remote record `+0x1088` (count at `+0x108c`),
appended here, and dropped by `FUN_00498760` the moment the packet is handed to the send. Nothing
resends it. The 4-bit count field also means the sixteenth queued hit of a tick is lost before it
is ever sent. The remake does not copy this: its hit is its own reliable message (the hit-authority
rule in [`../architecture/Net.md`](../architecture/Net.md)), which is a remake decision and not a
reading of this code.

The send rate is per peer and adaptive. `FUN_00497850(peerCount, distance)` returns the interval,
stored at remote `+0x106c`, and a peer is skipped entirely until its interval has passed unless
the caller forces it. The same walk pings a peer (type `0x23`) when its own 10-second timer at
`+0x1068` has expired.

## The death report

`FUN_00498a90(killer, param, source)` builds the 16-byte `0x12` once per death, behind the
one-shot latch `DAT_0071d1dd`, and calls the handler locally as well as sending it:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | type `0x12`, then length `0x10` |
| `+0x04` | the credited id, which is a remote record id and not a pilot id |
| `+0x08` | the caller's second argument, passed through untouched |
| `+0x0c` | the cause word, 1 to 4 |

The cause is chosen in the builder: a non-zero killer gives 1; no killer and no source gives 2
with the victim's own id at `+4`; a source that `FUN_0049b4a0` resolves gives 3; a source that
`FUN_00499de0` resolves gives 4. What each cause scores is in
[`multiplayer-scoring.md`](multiplayer-scoring.md).

### The team comparison is on the remote record, not the pilot record

`FUN_00498bf0`'s cause-1 arm compares `piVar5[0xf] == piVar3[0xf]`, and both pointers come from
`FUN_00499d80`, the lookup over the remote list headed at `DAT_0071c7a4`. That record is the
`0x1090`-byte object `FUN_00499c90` constructs, so the field is **remote record `+0x3c`**, and the
pilot record's `+0x08` is not read anywhere on this path.

What fills `+0x3c` is `FUN_00495310`: the pilot's own index (pilot record `+0x18`) when
`DAT_0071d89c` says the mode has no teams, and `FUN_0046f3c0(pilotRecord + 0x08)`'s `+0x18`, the
team's index, when it does. The colour table at `00628eb4` is indexed by the same slot, and
[`../formats/net-spawns.md`](../formats/net-spawns.md) reads it as the team half of the spawn slot
at `00496bba`. The team chat arm of `FUN_00499a50` compares the same field.

So the friendly-fire arm is correct as written and needs no team lookup: in an un-teamed match the
slot holds distinct per-pilot indices, two pilots never match, and the arm cannot fire.

### The kill lines

[Evidence: decoded] `FUN_00498bf0` posts the death's lines itself, so every peer posts them, the
dying pilot's own included, on every death, a crash included. The single-player kill line
(`vehicleDamage.md` "The kill message") is gated off in a network game and never adds to these.
A name is the remote record's CString at `+0x34`, which `FUN_00499c90` starts as row 6007
`MSG_UNKNOWN` ("Unknown"). The handler composes into two 0x31-byte stack buffers, a top line and a
second line, switched on the cause at `+0xc` through the jump table at `0x499028`:

| Cause | Top line | Second line |
|---|---|---|
| 1, a killer | the victim's name (`sprintf "%s"` at `0x498d0a`) | row 214 `MSG_DESTROYED_BY_X` "Destroyed by %1" with the killer's name, `FUN_0059cd70(buf, 0x31, 0xd6, ..)` at `0x498d20`, so cut at 48 characters |
| 2, no killer | row 7063 `MSG_MP_SUICIDE` "%1 Self-Destroyed" with the victim's name (`0x498d91`..`0x498da8`) | none |
| 3, a zeppelin part | the victim's name | row 7064 `MSG_MP_KILLED_X_ZEP` "Killed by %1 Zeppelin" with the team record's `+8` name (`FUN_0046e0f0`), at `0x498dfd` |
| 4, a turret owner | the victim's name | row 7065 `MSG_MP_KILLED_X_TURRET` "Killed by %1 Turret" with the owner's `+0x34`, at `0x498e70` |

The second line is posted first and only when non-empty (`0x498eae`..`0x498ecf`), then the top
line (`0x498ed7`..`0x498ee8`), so the victim's name reads above "Destroyed by". Both go through
`FUN_004588e0(line, 5.0, DAT_006eba60, DAT_006eba60)`: the HUD message stack, five seconds, in the
colour global the single-player kill line takes for a team above the player's. The Limited Lives
line (`0x498c52`..`0x498cba`, same colour) is posted before them and so reads below them. Row 7003
`MSG_DESTROYED_BY` ("was destroyed by") has no reference in the program: a search for the operand
`0x1b5b` finds none. After the posts the handler plays the combat voice (`FUN_004afd00`, codes
`0x14`..`0x17`), plays a remote victim's wreck, and on the host runs the score table.

The remake posts these lines from the host's decision rather than from each machine's copy of the
report, since a relayed report never returns to the machine that sent it. The host scores the
death, sends the scores, then sends `0x5C`, the death notice, and posts the lines itself; each
guest posts them from the notice, after the lives line the scores produced. A pilot is named by
its seat's callsign. Cause 3 names the owner's seat, since the remake's Dogfight has no teams.
Splitscreen Dogfight posts the same lines in every pane, named by player tag.

## The zeppelin state packet

`FUN_0049adf0` sends type `0x1e` unguaranteed on a fixed **0.5-second** cadence (`_DAT_0071d238`
is re-armed to `now + 0.5` after each send). It carries a zeppelin count in the byte at `+4`, then
`0x1c` per zeppelin (position, three fields from the object, and a packed word holding a 4-bit
event count), then `0x10` per pending event. Unlike the aircraft state it is a broadcast, and like
the aircraft state its event tail is dropped once sent.

The builder runs on the host alone (`FUN_005b4210`, my id `[0x9c7860]` against the host's
`[0x9c7864]`), once the clock `[0x9ad748]` reaches `_DAT_0071d238`; the half second is the float at
`0x006032e0`, re-armed at `0x0049b00b`. It walks the zeppelin vector `0x71df84`..`0x71df88` in
order, so a zeppelin is named by its index in that vector, and sends through
`FUN_005b2640(buf, len, 0, 0)`: unguaranteed, to everyone. One zeppelin's `0x1c` bytes:

| Offset | Field | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x00` | position, three floats | the hull node's world position, `[[zep+0x1c]+0x38]+0x54` |
| `+0x0c` | speed, float | `zep+0xa4`, the throttle `FUN_004bf240` writes |
| `+0x10` | pitch, float radians | `zep+0x30` |
| `+0x14` | yaw, float radians | `zep+0x2c` |
| `+0x18` | part states, 2 bits per part | `FUN_004c0c20` over the list at `zep+0x5c` |
| `+0x1a` | event count in bits 0..3; above it per-part bits of the list at `zep+0x7c` | `[0x71c838] & 0xf`, `FUN_004c0d80` |

Each event is `0x10` bytes, a target point as three floats and a `u16` part index at `+0xc`, taken
from the global list `0x71c834` that `FUN_0049b030` fills when a zeppelin cannon shoots. After the
send, when `[0x71c190]` is 0 and a zeppelin's dead flag `zep+6` is set, the builder ends the
zeppelin match: `FUN_0046ecd0(index + 1, 3)`, `FUN_004996d0(3)` and the score table `FUN_00499270`.

The receiver, `FUN_0049b0b0`, writes zeppelin `i` of the packet into entry `i` of its own vector with
no check against its length. The position goes to a target at `zep+0xe4` and the speed to `zep+0xa4`.
The facing becomes a unit forward at `zep+0xf0`: `(-sin yaw cos pitch, sin pitch, -cos yaw cos pitch)`.
`FUN_004c0cb0` applies the part states (1 and 2 through `FUN_004455e0`, 0 and 3 through
`FUN_00445620`). Each event goes to `FUN_004c0d00(part, point)`, which fires `wep_28` (the string at
`0x62b828`) from that part toward the point through `FUN_005aef40`. The high bits of `+0x1a` are not
read.

A guest does not step its own path. `FUN_004bf9d0` asks `FUN_00470550`, which answers false on the
host and otherwise runs the chase:

- `k = FUN_0053e2e0(2 dt)`, which is `e^(-2 dt)` from a table of `exp(-i/51)` (the constants at
  `0x60912c` and `0x609128`, clamped at the 5.0 of `0x6036bc`);
- the hull position becomes `k * position + (1 - k) * target` (`FUN_00538c50`), written to `zep+0x20`;
- the forward from its own yaw and pitch is blended the same way toward `zep+0xf0` and normalised
  (`FUN_00538d20`, `FUN_00422690`); pitch is `asin(forward.y)` and yaw `atan2(-forward.x, -forward.z)`;
- the target is carried on by `speed * dt` along the blended forward, so between packets the target
  is dead-reckoned;
- `FUN_004bf930` writes the pose.

The guest's velocity query `FUN_004bf7f0` answers speed times the received forward. On a straight
leg a guest's hull trails the host's by the speed times the link's latency, plus the speed over the
chase rate, `v / 2` metres.

## The lobby settings block

[Evidence: decoded] The host builds type `0x26` in `FUN_004134e0` (gated on `FUN_005b4210`, the
block stored at `0x413533`). A receiver's `FUN_00415940` hands it to `FUN_00414040`, which copies 40
bytes back into `0x642f8c` and posts `0x3f7`. The block at `+4` is a copy of `0x642f8c`..`0x642fb3`:

| Block offset | Global | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x00` | `0x642f8c` | environment |
| `+0x04` | `0x642f90` | mission type |
| `+0x08` | `0x642f94` | victory kind (0 Time, 1 Score) |
| `+0x0c` | `0x642f98` | victory value |
| `+0x10` | `0x642f9c` | restrict-teams byte |
| `+0x14`, `+0x18` | `0x642fa0`, `0x642fa4` | team minimum and maximum |
| `+0x1c` | `0x642fa8` | Limited Lives byte |
| `+0x20` | `0x642fac` | lives count dword |
| `+0x24` | `0x642fb0` | Auto Respawn byte |
| `+0x25` | `0x642fb1` | Allow Custom Planes byte |
| `+0x26`, `+0x27` | | unmapped |

[Evidence: decoded] The outlaw list follows at message `+0x2c`, packed by `FUN_00410800` (below),
and the whole message is sent unguaranteed (`FUN_005b2640(.., 0, 0)`). [Evidence: undecoded] What
triggers the send, and bytes `+0x26`..`+0x27`, are open. No message carries a pilot's remaining lives: each peer seeds them from
this block and counts them down on the `0x12` death reports
([`multiplayer-scoring.md`](multiplayer-scoring.md)). The remake's `0x53` carries the same lives
settings and nothing more.

## Custom planes

[Evidence: decoded] Allow Custom Planes is the byte at `0x642fb1`, written by the lobby's check at
`0x40dde5` and read at `0x40deeb`, `0x40f053` and `0x407f04`. The lobby globals are zero-initialised,
so a new lobby allows no custom planes. At Ready (`0x407f02`) the program copies it to `0x61f2ec` and
calls `FUN_00414580(1)`.

The outlaw list is one object at `0x64e168`, built by `FUN_00410560`, of 34 byte flags:

| Flags | Outlaws | Check |
|---|---|---|
| 0..10 | one airframe each, in airframe order | `FUN_00410cc0` |
| 11..15 | one gun calibre each; calibre 5, no gun, is always allowed | `FUN_00410c10` |
| 16..19 | one ammunition each; 4, none, is always allowed | `FUN_00410c40` |
| 20..30 | one rocket-table row each; row 11, none, is always allowed | `FUN_00410c80` |
| 31 | every rocket | `FUN_00410c80` |
| 32 | every ammunition | `FUN_00410c40` |
| 33 | nitro-boosted engines: engines 3 to 5 refused, engine 6 (none) always refused | `FUN_00410cf0` |

`FUN_00410800` packs the list into five bytes, lowest flag in bit 0 of the first byte, and
`FUN_00410930` unpacks it. `FUN_00410d30` checks a plane record's engine (`+0x30`), airframe
(`+0x2c`) and four guns (`+0x88`) against it.

The Ready check runs on each client, for its own pick only, in the Ready callback at `0x40f026`. A
custom plane (`0x645c10 == 1`) is refused while Allow Custom Planes is clear, and so is a record the
check fails; `FUN_0040fa30` then clears the pick. A mounted gun's outlawed ammunition refuses Ready
and `FUN_0040fa60(4)` sets all four guns' ammunition to none. A loaded pylon's outlawed rocket
refuses Ready and `FUN_0040fa90(11)` sets all eight pylons to none and both hardpoint counts to 0.
Outlaw All Ammo and Outlaw All Rockets make the same resets without refusing. A refusal shows langui
10517 followed by 10514 (plane), 10515 (ammunition) and 10516 (rockets) for each reason, and a
second Ready takes the reset fit. The host does not validate a remote pick.

A pilot's plane travels as DirectPlay player data: `FUN_00414470` writes 80 bytes through
`FUN_005b31f0` (SetPlayerData, guaranteed). It carries the airframe, the paint pattern, three decals,
three colours and each gun slot's weapon id. It does not carry the engine, the armour or the
hardpoints, so a remote copy of a custom plane flies on the stock template's. `FUN_004136e0` builds
the remote planes from it, and in a team game the team colours replace the paint.

The stock templates at `0x619f58` (stride `0xcc`) all carry engine 1. Their guns, at `+0x88`..`+0x94`,
are what the check reads for a stock pick:

| Airframe | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Guns | 0,5,5,5 | 2,1,5,2 | 2,2,0,0 | 1,0,5,5 | 3,0,5,0 | 2,1,0,5 | 4,0,5,0 | 4,0,5,5 | 3,2,5,1 | 2,1,5,5 | 4,2,5,5 |

## The lobby roster

`FUN_004135f0` sends type `0x27`, the widest message in the protocol and the only one the remake
borrows an id from for a roster. A player count sits at `+4`, then `0x20` per player: the player
index, a second dword, an 18-character name copied with `strncpy` and zero-terminated at `+0x1a`,
a dword at `+0x1c`, and a variable tail of that player's own list. It is sent guaranteed to
everybody, whole, every time anything changes; there is no delta form.

`0x27` is the highest type word the program uses, which is why the remake mints its own ids above
it.

## What the remake takes

`Net/NetMessages.cs` keeps the two-word header and the original's id for every event that has a
counterpart here: `0x0f` aircraft state, `0x10` fire, `0x12` death with its four causes, `0x13`
score, `0x17` match state, `0x22` hit and `0x27` seat roster. Damage, spawn, the mission
director transition, the join handshake and a seat's ask to be spawned again have no
counterpart, so they are minted at `0x40`, `0x41`, `0x42`, `0x43` and `0x44`, above the ceiling
above. The host-owned world's four (AI state, AI fire, a guest's hit claim on an AI, and a world
event) are minted at `0x45` to `0x48`, below, the clock ping at `0x49`, the lobby's session advert at `0x4A`, the zeppelin path at `0x4B`, a generator's AI launch at `0x4C`, the surface-vehicle patrol at `0x4D`, a positional start at `0x4E`, the lobby's session closed at `0x4F`, and the lobby's co-op flow, co-op pick and co-op seat fit at `0x50` to `0x52`, the Dogfight lobby's options, roster and chat at `0x53` to `0x55`, the lobby's build version at `0x56`, a guest's destructible hit at `0x57`, a cutscene skip at `0x58`, the lobby's co-op wingman at `0x59`, the lobby's co-op film at `0x5A`, the start barrier's word at `0x5B`, a match's death notice at `0x5C`, and the lobby's plane build and plane rules at `0x5D` and `0x5E`. The handshake carries the master seed, the host's clock and the seat the joining peer was
given; the original needs none of the three, because it draws from no shared stream and hands
out no seat. The ask carries a seat and nothing else: the original's client takes its own
respawn, while here the host owns every placement and answers the ask with a spawn event.

`0x17` is the one original id the remake widens. The original's twelve bytes carry a clock and a
reason, which is all a client that runs its own countdown needs. The remake's twenty carry the
remaining time, both limits, the reason and the host's session clock, because a guest here runs
no countdown of its own: it is told the clock, and that field is also the reading its
`NetClockSlew` takes an offset from, since the periodic tick is the only message a running match
repeats. Both limits ride even though the original arms exactly one, which costs four bytes a
second and leaves an exclusive lobby nothing to change on the wire.

The clock ping is minted at `0x49` rather than taking `0x23`, though it has the original's shape:
twelve bytes, two stamps, one peer, a ten-second timer (`Net/NetClockPing.cs`). The stamps
differ in kind. The original's are `GetTickCount` milliseconds and it pings to learn a peer's
latency, one side of each pair asking; the remake's are session-clock seconds, and only a guest
asks, because the host's clock is the one being read. It is unreliable where the original's is
guaranteed, since a retransmitted question would measure the retransmission as link. The guest
reads the host's clock forward by half the round trip, and the first answer replaces the offset
the handshake opened on. It is also the periodic clock reading a campaign session has, where no
match state ticks.

Fire (`0x10`) is unreliable and unsequenced where the original's is guaranteed, and rides a
channel per seat apart from that seat's state (`Net/NetChannels.cs`). Sequenced beside state, a
burst sent between two samples was discarded as overtaken whenever jitter swapped them, and
rounds fired on one step would discard each other the same way. Unsequenced, a burst is spawned
whichever order it lands in; a reliable burst would stall behind a retransmission.

The remake does not take the batching: its hit and damage messages are reliable and separate, its
score message is one seat rather than the whole table, and its roster carries the match seed,
which the original has no need of because it never draws from a shared stream. The packed angle
and motion dwords are not taken either; the remake spends 8 bytes on a quantised quaternion and
12 on a float velocity, which is the trade `Net/NetMessages.cs`'s width budget exists to hold.

## The mission director

`0x42` carries one event of the host's objectives graph as a code, an id and the host's clock,
reliable, in the order the graph raised it. The host is the only sender; a guest's graph is
replicated and changes only by replaying these (`Session/Objectives/NetDirectorLink.cs`). The message is 16
bytes: the header, a `u16` code, two bytes of padding, an `i32` id, and an `f32` `HostClock`, the
host's session time when its graph raised the event. The codes are `NetDirectorEvent`:

| Code | Event | Id |
|---|---|---|
| 1 to 7 | Woke, Napped, Completed, Killed, Slept, Expired, Hidden | objective number in the low 16 bits, the objective whose completion caused it in the high 16 (0 for none) |
| 8 | Settled: a completion and every chain it ran are done | objective number |
| 9 | The mission countdown expired | 0 |
| 10 | Ending decided | outcome, plus `0x100` when the objectives-won or objectives-lost sound played |
| 11 | Mission ended, after the host's wrap-up | outcome |

A code the guest does not know is dropped. `Hidden` exists because `HIDE_OBJ` retires an objective
without the completion bookkeeping, and a guest that did not hear it would complete that objective
later by a rule of its own. Nap lengths are not sent: the guest reads them off the same script,
from the source objective's `NAP_OBJECTIVE_WHEN_I_COMPLETE` or the objective's own nap.

What a guest replays, and what it derives from what it replayed:

- **Replayed, presentation.** Each transition runs the same bookkeeping on the guest as on the
  host: `WAKE_ANIM` and `SLEEP_ANIM`, the wake, completed, class-complete and ending sound groups,
  `STOP_QUEUED_SOUNDS`, the objective and other target lists, the help labels, the countdown's
  reset, adjust and end actions, and the display rows. The countdown's display runs locally
  between events, pinned at zero, and only the host's code 9 expires it.
- **Replayed for now, world.** `WAKEUP_ENEMIES`, `WAKEUP_TURRETS`, `WAKEUP_ZEP_TURRETS`,
  `WAKEUP_GENERATOR`, `SET_AI_TEAM`, `SET_AI_NET`, `SET_AI_ATTACK_RADIUS`,
  `COMPLETED_ZEPCANNONS`, `COMPLETED_STOPPOINT` and `START_TAXI` run through the guest's own world
  seam. A guest's AI aircraft is a replicated airframe (below), so a warp, a net or a team set on
  it is overwritten by the host's next sample. `WAKEUP_ENEMIES` does not wake it: the host's wake
  arrives as a presence event (below), which is what takes it out of `Inert` so the samples show.
  `WAKEUP_GENERATOR` credits the guest's own cycles, whose aircraft launches are refused (below).
  Turrets still act on these locally. A guest's zeppelin or surface vehicle takes the net but walks
  nothing, since its path is the host's samples.
- **Drawn by the host, world.** `WARP_VEHICLE` picks one of its waypoints on the world stream, and
  its only authored use hides an aircraft that stays `Inert`, which the host sends no samples for.
  The host sends the pick as world event 4, and a guest's directive draws nothing: it places the
  aircraft on the host's pick, when the directive runs or when the pick arrives, whichever is later.
  `DEDG`'s engagement widening is a side effect of testing a condition, so a guest never runs it.
- **Derived, cutscene codes.** The presentation codes (20, 2, 11, 1, 10, 913 and 914, 666 and 667,
  951, 86) are raised on the guest by its own animation runtime, playing the definitions its
  replayed `WAKE_ANIM` or the shared start list started. Sending them as well would apply each one
  twice.
- **Refused on a guest.** Code 13, the docking's mission completion, is refused by a replicated
  graph; the host's own code 13 decides the ending and codes 10 and 11 carry it. The condition
  hooks (a player lost, a danger zone completed) and a direct wake are refused the same way.
- **Not the director's.** 801 to 803 (a Black Hat launch), 968 (a wingman taken out) and 800 (a
  generator's credit) change AI world state and still run locally on each end. A Black Hat launch
  reactivates a block built dormant with its ordinal, so on a guest it waits for the host's presence
  event like `WAKEUP_ENEMIES`; 800's credit launches nothing there of its own. 965 to 967 (the
  airframe swap) belong to the episode's owner and run on every end (below). Definitions started
  by a player's position are not graph events: the landing rows and the ladder switch cross as
  `0x4E` (below), as does the one `PlayerRange` gate whose definitions raise a code; the other
  `PlayerRange` conditions run on each end over the whole field.
  The escorting wingman is a roster block spawned at build, not a director event.

A guest applies each event on arrival and then catches up on it (`Session/Objectives/NetDirectorCatchUp.cs`).
The lateness is the guest's shared clock minus the stamp, never negative. What the event started
is advanced by that much:
- the objective's private timer, its nap and a countdown it set;
- the cutscene instances it started and their motions, stepped at the authored frame so their
  timed events and codes fire in order (a code the host raised during that time is raised on
  arrival);
- a one-shot, started that far into its clip, or skipped when the clip is already over;
- a radio call, whose start delay is shortened by the lateness and which, past it, joins at the
  line and offset the host's is at.
Particle emitters, light animations and a music cue start at their own beginning on arrival. None
of them has a position to seek, and none is timed against the rest.
The shared clock is `Net/NetClockSlew.cs`'s. Its one-way readings are read forward by half the
round trip `0x49` measures (below), so a lateness read against it is the whole time the event
spent on the link, not only the excess over the average.
A guest's mission end holds the world and builds the result without writing a profile, a
photograph or an award. A guest that joins late has missed every earlier event.

## The host-owned world

The host flies every AI aircraft and decides every world hit; a guest replicates the state and
replays nothing that draws from the AI stream (`Session/World/NetWorldLink.cs`). The same seed is not the
same AI: the mode machine rolls on the AI stream every step, so two ends running one AI would part
on the first roll that landed differently. An AI is named on the wire by its admission ordinal, its
index in the roster's append-only AI list, which both ends grow in the same order for the aircraft
built with the world. The one source that grows it later is a generator's aircraft launch, and a
guest builds those only from the host's `0x4C`, so the two lists cannot part on a launch timed
differently or credited on one end alone. Black Hat launches and `WAKEUP_ENEMIES` add nothing to
the list: they reactivate blocks built dormant, whose ordinals already stand.

| Id | Message | Class | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x45` | AI state | unreliable, on the event channel | ordinal, per-AI sequence, pose, velocity, lever, surfaces, nitro (48 bytes) |
| `0x46` | AI fire | unreliable | ordinal, weapon index, muzzle, aim (28 bytes) |
| `0x47` | AI hit | reliable, guest to host | ordinal, shooter seat, weapon, damage share, part, impact in the AI's body space (28 bytes) |
| `0x48` | World event | reliable, host to all | code, subject, argument, value (16 bytes) |
| `0x4B` | Zeppelin state | unreliable, host to all | placement index, per-zeppelin sequence, position, speed, pitch, yaw (32 bytes) |
| `0x4C` | AI spawn | reliable, host to all | admission ordinal, launch counter, generator index, net index, flags, lever, position, drop direction, velocity (44 bytes) |
| `0x4D` | Surface vehicle state | unreliable, host to all | spawn index, per-hull sequence, name hash, position, speed, yaw (32 bytes) |
| `0x57` | Destructible hit | reliable, guest to host | registration index, name hash, health damage (16 bytes) |

`0x4C` is one generator aircraft launch. The host admits the aircraft as it launches and sends the
ordinal it got; the guest builds the launch only when that ordinal is its own next one, which
reliable ordered delivery makes the normal case, and drops it otherwise. The guest builds with the
host's net pick, pose, launch velocity and lever, and forms the name from the host's launch counter,
so the mission script names the same aircraft on both ends. A guest's own cycles still run their
timers and doors, but its spawner refuses every aircraft launch they come due for. No take-off run
is started on the guest, since the host's samples fly the copy along it. A surface hull launch is
not carried here.

`0x4B` is one zeppelin of the original's `0x1e`, its first `0x18` bytes in the original's order, on the
same half second. A zeppelin is named by its placement index, which both ends build from the same
records. The part-state word and the cannon-shot tail are not carried: a part's death arrives as a
pool event, and each end's cannons still fire on their own. A guest runs the original's chase
(`Flight/Airframe/ZeppelinReplica.cs`) in place of its follower, so the two ends cannot part on a branch
pick. A hull the host holds, has not woken or has lost is not sent, and the guest's copy stays where
the last sample left it.

`0x4D` has no counterpart in the original, which has no campaign across a link and so no patrol
boat to send. It takes `0x4B`'s half second and its chase, with the pitch dropped because a hull
rides the water. A hull is named by its index in the surface runtime's spawn list and by the name
hash `0x48`'s code 3 uses; a guest checks the hash and searches by it when a generator's launch has
shifted the index. A patrol replayed on each end diverges without a branch draw: the wake arrives
late, a `SET_AI_NET` starts its route from wherever the hull stands, and a launch spawns on each
end's own timer. The roster and `SET_AI_NET` nets of C1B/M03 and C2/M01 carry no node with three
or more neighbours, and C2/M01's launch net carries one, so the branch pick is the smallest of the
four.

AI state is plain unreliable rather than sequenced because every AI shares one channel, and a
transport sequence would drop one AI's sample against another's; each AI's own pose buffer drops a
stale one by the per-AI sequence. It rides the seat stream's cadence. The world event codes are
`NetWorldEvent`: 1 an AI downed (the argument is the killer's seat or -1), 2 an AI's hull fraction,
3 a destructible pool's health (the subject is its registration
index, the argument a hash of its definition and anchor names, which the guest checks before
applying and searches by when the index has shifted), 4 a `WARP_VEHICLE` pick (the subject is the
drawn waypoint index, the argument the hash of the warped vehicle's name), 5 an AI's presence (the argument is 1 for in
play and 0 for deactivated). The host sends 5 whenever an AI's `Inert` changes outside a cutscene
park, which covers a script wake, a Black Hat launch and a wingman taken out. A cutscene park (913)
is not sent, because each end's own cutscene parks its own copy. 6 a seat left (the subject is
the seat of a guest whose link dropped mid-mission): the host sends it to the guests still flying,
every end removes that aeroplane and tells its players "<name> left", and the mission goes on.

Code 3 goes out at once for a stage change or a kill. A hit that lowers a pool without either is
held and sent on the seat stream's next tick, one sample per pool however many hits landed, because
three guest-visible rules read the health between stages: the target bar's fraction
(`Flight/Weapons/TargetPool.cs`), a surface hull's injure ladder (`Flight/Ai/SurfaceVehicle.cs`), and every
`ANIM_HEALTH` condition. A sample waiting when a stage change goes out is dropped, since the stage
event carries the same health. Chip samples ride the reliable class with the stage events: a guest
only ever lowers a pool, so an old sample arriving late changes nothing, and a lost last one would
leave the guest's copy high until the next hit.

A hit on an AI is decided once: by the host for its own rounds and for every round no seat fired,
and by a guest for its own seat's rounds, which it claims with `0x47`. A world pool is spent only
on the host, which simulates every round, a guest's included, from the fire events; a guest's
world runtime reports a struck pool as hit and spends nothing. A ram on an aeroplane flown
elsewhere spends nothing on it either, since its owner's own sweep resolves that half.

The debug kill key (F17) on a guest kills nothing locally. On an aeroplane it offers the victim's
hit router one lethal round from the guest's own fit, so an AI is claimed with `0x47` and another
seat's aeroplane with the seat hit `0x22`, and the owner's death reaches the guest as `0x48` code 1
or `0x12`. On a pool it sends `0x57`, which names the pool as code 3 does; the host spends
it through its own damage path, and the kill comes back as code 3. `0x57` has no counterpart in the
original, and a guest's rounds never use it, since the host replays them from the fire events.

Each simulation phase, as a guest runs it:

| Phase | On a guest |
|---|---|
| Ending hold, radio, smoke screens, beeper tags, incoming fire | Local presentation or per-pane rules, no world authority. |
| Landing approaches, ladder switch | **Host-decided**: a row start and a ladder holder arrive as `0x4E`; the guest offers the auto-land prompt to its own humans and sends their held button. |
| World animation | Local, except a `PlayerRange` gate whose definitions raise a code, which is **host-decided** and read from `0x4E`'s range gate verdict. |
| Capture AI aircraft | Local membership; new AI are admitted by ordinal before any is stepped. |
| Projectiles | Local on every end, spawned from fire events; the guest's rounds spend nothing on the world or on an AI. |
| Human aircraft | Replicated per seat (`0x0f`, `0x10`, `0x22`, `0x40`, `0x12`). |
| Captured AI aircraft | **Replicated**: each AI flies from `0x45` samples; fire arrives as `0x46`, hull and death as `0x48`. |
| Zeppelins | **Replicated path**: each hull chases the host's `0x4B` samples. Part and cannon deaths arrive as pool events; the broadside still fires locally. |
| Turret emplacements | Replayed locally and cosmetic: a guest's turret round spends nothing, the host's decides. Deaths arrive as pool events. |
| Generators | **Host-owned launches**: each aircraft launch arrives as `0x4C` at the host's ordinal. The guest's cycles and doors run on its own timers and are cosmetic; their aircraft launches are refused. |
| Surface vehicles | **Replicated patrol**: each hull chases the host's `0x4D` samples. A hull's death arrives as a pool event; its gun still fires locally. |
| Instant action | Not run in a network match. |
| Campaign | The director replay above. |
| AI voice | Derived locally; a replicated AI runs no mode machine, so its mode-driven call-outs are silent. |
| Versus | The match state above. |

## Positional starts

A landing row and the ladder switch start definitions off where a human is, and in a campaign
across a link that human may be flying on another machine. The host decides both over the whole
field, its own panes and each guest's copy, and sends the decision; a guest's trigger and switch
are replicated and decide nothing (`Session/Campaign/NetPositionalStartLink.cs`). Deciding on each end
instead would start a row twice or not at all, since each end reads a guest's aeroplane a buffer
delay apart.

| Id | Message | Class | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x4E` | Positional start | reliable | kind, seat, flags (bit 0 held), row index in the bound table (12 bytes) |

The kinds are `NetPositionalStart`:

| Kind | Sender | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Landing row | host to all | the row the host's trigger started, and the seat whose flying started it |
| 2 Ladder holder | host to all | the seat now holding the switch, or no seat |
| 3 Auto-land held | guest to host | the guest's own seat has the auto-land button down while offered the prompt, or has let it go |
| 4 Range gate | host to all | the host's verdict on a code-raising `PlayerRange` gate, sent when it changes: the row is the gate name's hash, the held flag the verdict, no seat |

A guest starts the named row for the named seat's rig, which makes that seat the episode's owner
on the guest as on the host. An `auto` row's prompt is per pane, so a guest still tests its own
humans against the row and draws the prompt; a press is held from the button until the prompt goes
away, because the host's copy reaches the sphere a buffer delay later and a one-frame press would
be over by then. The host accepts a held button only from the machine that owns the seat, and its
copy of that seat answers the auto-land test with it.

What the row then plays is derived on each end from its own playback, like the director's
cutscene codes. The airframe swap (965 to 967) runs on every end for the owner's seat: the owner's
machine rebuilds its own aeroplane, every other end rebuilds its copy as a copy again, fed by the
same seat's samples and wired for combat as a fresh seat is. The captured aircraft's group and
hidden hull are applied on every end. The hand-over to the wingman activates a block built with
the world, so it names an ordinal both ends already hold, and the host's samples fly it on a
guest. A guest's scripted player, which an episode claimed by nobody
belongs to, is the host's first seat.

A `PlayerRange` gate is the host's when its definition, or one it starts through
`CALL_ANIMATION`, raises a `CALLBACK` (`Mech3/Anim/RangeGateAuthority.cs`). The host tests it
over its whole field and sends kind 4 when the verdict changes; a guest answers the gate with the
host's last verdict and never tests it against its own field. A pass the guest's gate has not read
yet is held until it is read, so a host pass shorter than the gate's poll still starts the
definition once on the guest. The gate is named by its definition, anchor and radius in metres
squared (`blacke_drop/blacke_marker/4096`), and the wire carries that name's FNV-1a hash.

Of the 216 shipped animation names carrying a `PlayerRange` condition (1016 definitions over the
shared, chapter and mission sources), C4/M03's `blacke_drop` is the only one whose closure raises a
code: its 64 m gate on `blacke_marker` starts `bdplayer`, `bdchute` and the two drop cameras, which
raise cutscene codes 11, 951, 1 and 2, and it reaches `dropped_blacke`, which the mission's
objectives read. Every other gate stays on each end over the whole field, so its start can differ
between ends by the link delay:
- the ordnance washes (the gun hits, ground effects, flak, muzzle bursts), which each machine draws
  for its own viewer;
- the zeppelin props at 270 m, the MP-map and repair-base `call_door` at 25 m, C1's lightning,
  C1/M02's `pure_panic` and C1B/M03's `foghorn_toot`;
- C4/M03's `blacke_drop_east` on `blk_e_marker`, which picks which drop camera leg plays. Both
  legs raise the same codes, so the choice is presentation, but the two ends can show different
  legs;
- C5/M02's `arcadia_start` at 1400 m, which burns the Workers' Voyage's gas bags and so sets the
  `panels` nodes its objectives count inactive. A node state, not a code: the guest's objectives
  are the host's replicated graph, and the burn is drawn on each end.

Every end draws the episode owner on the staged `player` marker, the owner's own machine and every
other one alike. On an end where that seat is a copy fed by samples, the copy is in no pane, and
the cutscene host poses it on the marker each frame over the pose its samples write, then hands it
back to its feed at the handoff. A guest's docking therefore shows the guest's aeroplane on the
host, and the host's docking shows the host's on each guest.

## Cutscene skip

Every end plays each shared episode (an intro, a landing row, a director-started film), and any
player's skip ends it on every machine: the splitscreen rule, where any seat's skip ends the one
film for every pane, carried across the link. The original has no counterpart, since it runs no
campaign across a link and its cutscene code 914 is the one it skips in multiplayer. The host
decides (`Session/World/NetCutsceneLink.cs`).

| Id | Message | Class | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x58` | Cutscene skip | reliable, guest to host (an ask) and host to all (the skip) | skipper's seat, a reserved byte, the episode's ordinal, the episode's key (12 bytes) |

A guest's skip input ends nothing locally: it sends the ask and the guest plays on. The host takes
an ask only from the machine that owns the seat, skips its own episode and broadcasts the skip,
and a host's own skip is broadcast the same way. The asking guest ends its episode on that
broadcast like every other guest.

An episode is named by its definition's name key (the FNV-1a hash the world messages use) and by
how many episodes of that definition this end has played, counting this one. Both ends play the
same episodes of a definition in the same order, so the pair names one film on every machine, and
a late or repeated skip names an episode that is already over there and is dropped rather than
ending the next one. A skip for an episode an end has not started yet, or has started but not yet
armed for skipping, is held and applied the frame that episode can take it, since a guest's replay
can start a film after the host's skip of it arrives.

The skip notice (`SplitScreen.NoteSkip`) is the pressing machine's own: it names the local skipper
on the machine where the input landed, and no machine names a skipper from another.

## The start barrier

Every machine holds its flight on its load screen until every machine flying a seat has built its
world, and then all of them start (`Net/NetStartGate.cs`). The original has no counterpart. The
word is a session message: it is sent only once the sender's handlers stand, so it never waits in
the lobby.

| Id | Message | Class | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x5B` | Start gate | reliable, guest to host (loaded) and host to all (start) | word at 4 (loaded 1, start 2), three reserved bytes (8 bytes) |

A guest sends loaded as the last act of its build, before its first simulated step. The host
waits on every linked machine that flies a seat, and broadcasts start when the last one reports,
drops, or does not answer within the timeout. A loaded that reaches a host already started is
answered with a start to that machine alone. While a machine holds, its clock takes no step: the
mission clock, the AI, the director and the world events wait with the aeroplanes, and only the
link and the clock ping are stepped. The host-owned world therefore sends nothing to a guest
before that guest's world can apply it, unless the wait gave up on that guest.

## The lobby

Before any session binds the carrier, a `Net/NetLobby.cs` stands on it. A host sends the advert
there, to each peer as it connects and again whenever the offer changes, and sends session closed
to every guest before it closes the socket or to a guest it has no seat for. A guest's lobby keeps
the latest of each and never passes either to the session, so the session's own vocabulary never
sees them.

| Id | Message | Class | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x4A` | Session advert | reliable, host to each guest | session kind (Dogfight 1, campaign co-op 2) at 4, campaign mission sequence or `0xFF` for none at 5, player count at 6, status at 7 (unknown 0, waiting 1, in mission 2, full 3), seat cap at 8, three reserved bytes, host name in 16 bytes UTF-8 zero padded at 12 (28 bytes) |
| `0x4F` | Session closed | reliable, host to each guest | reason at 4 (unknown 0, closed 1, full 2, version mismatch 3), three reserved bytes, the host's build version at 8, the guest's as the host heard it at 12 (16 bytes) |
| `0x56` | Build version | reliable, each end to each peer on connect | the build version at 4 (8 bytes) |

A guest that reads a closed reason tells the player the host closed the game, that the game was
full, or which two versions kept them apart, instead of reading the dropped link as a lost
connection. An unknown status or reason reads as unknown rather than failing the message, so a
newer host's value does not strand an older guest.

### The build version check

A build version is MAJOR.MINOR of the SemVer string in `project.godot`, as `Net/NetBuildVersion.cs`
parses it: the major and the minor, 16 bits little endian each. Both words at `0xFFFF` are unknown,
the version of a build whose string does not parse, and a version with one word at `0xFFFF` fails
the message. Two builds play together when their majors and minors match, so builds a patch apart
play and builds a minor apart do not. Unknown plays only with unknown: a build that cannot name its
version never joins a build that can.

Each lobby sends its build version first on every connect, before the advert. A lobby that hears a
version that does not play with its own takes that peer off every peer list and drops everything
it sends except a session closed. A host door then sends that guest session closed with the
version mismatch reason and both versions, and hangs up after the same grace as a guest refused
as full. A guest door refuses a host of another version itself, so a host that never says why is
still refused with both versions named. A peer that sends no build version is not refused. The
command line's `--net-host` and `--net-join` stand no lobby on the carrier and check nothing.

⚠ The layouts of `0x56`, `0x4F` and the LAN discovery reply do not change. They are how two builds
of different minors recognise each other, so a change makes an older build read a newer one as
silent or foreign instead of naming the mismatch.

### Campaign co-op boards

A co-op guest follows the host's boards through five more lobby messages, minted at `0x50` to
`0x52`, `0x59` and `0x5A` since the original has no campaign across a link. None reaches a session.

| Id | Message | Class | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x50` | Co-op flow | reliable, host to each guest | screen at 4 (unknown 0, cabin 1, briefing 2, flight check 3, in mission 4, debrief 5), mission sequence at 5, round at 6, the guest's player number at 7, Ready mask by player number at 8, humans at 9, host's campaign progress at 10, flags at 11 (bit 0 won), hangar airframe mask at 12, the guest's local seats at 14, one reserved byte, objectives mask at 16, cash at 20 (24 bytes) |
| `0x51` | Co-op pick | reliable, guest to host | round at 4, flags at 5 (bit 0 Ready, bit 1 left the flight), airframe at 6, one reserved byte, the fit at 8, the player name at 20 (16 bytes, zero-padded; 36 bytes) |
| `0x52` | Co-op seat fit | reliable, host to each guest | seat at 4, three reserved bytes, the fit at 8 (20 bytes) |
| `0x59` | Co-op wingman | reliable, host to each guest | wingman airframe at 4 (`0xFF` none), three reserved bytes, the fit at 8 (20 bytes) |
| `0x5A` | Co-op film | reliable, host to each guest | ordinal at 4, playing at 5, film at 6 (chapter 1, closing 2), chapter at 7 (8 bytes) |

A fit is twelve bytes: the four gun slots' ammunition, then the eight ordnance cells, one byte
each, each the profile's stored value plus one so that zero reads as unset (stock). The pick
carries a guest's own plane record's ammunition and ordnance. At its launch the host sends every
guest a seat fit for each seat, its own seats included, before the session's opener on the same
ordered channel. Every machine then builds each seat flown elsewhere with its own pilot's fit.
After the seat fits and before the opener the host also sends each guest a co-op wingman naming
its profile's wingman airframe and fit. A guest's director has no profile of its own, so it binds
the campaign's `wingman_1` from that word, and both machines build the host-owned wingman in the
same def with the same damage parts. A guest with no word flies the block's own def and says so in
a warning; it never substitutes its own default. `0xFF` names no pick, which also flies the block's
def. A guest a patch older drops `0x59` as unknown and flies the old default.
A co-op film names the campaign film the host's board has up: a chapter's opening film before the
cabin, or the closing film before the book. The host sends it playing when the film starts and
again with the same ordinal and playing clear when it ends, played out or skipped, and it goes
out at once rather than on the next flow, so a guest reads the end before the board that follows.
A guest plays the film it names and ends it on the host's end. A guest's own skip ends only its
own film, since the host drives the boards. A guest joining while a film plays sees none, and a
guest back from flight joins a film still playing. A launch ends a guest's film still up, so the
guest flies with its host. A guest a patch older drops `0x5A` as unknown and plays no film.
The name is the guest's last-played pilot, read without writing, and the host's roster calls
the guest by it; a guest with none is called by its player number. A guest leaving the flight
through its pause sheet sets the left flag, and the host takes its seat out at once, as it does
for a dropped link.

The host sends a flow to each guest whenever its boards change, since the player number differs
per guest. The round advances when the mission changes, and on any screen change other than
between the briefing and the flight check, and it clears every Ready. A pick counts only under the
host's current round, so a Ready given before the host backed out never launches the next mission.
The host's launch waits until every guest's latest pick is Ready. While the host flies, the flow
says in mission and the advert's status is in mission, so a guest joining then waits in the cabin.
The debrief flow carries the host's result, which every guest's scrapbook shows.

### Dogfight lobby

The Multiplayer Lobby runs over five more lobby messages, minted at `0x53` to `0x55`, `0x5D` and `0x5E`, with a
guest's plane and Ready riding the co-op pick at `0x51` under the lobby's own round. None reaches a
session.

| Id | Message | Class | Carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x53` | Dogfight options | reliable, host to each guest | round at 4, environment at 5, mission type at 6 (Capture the Flag 0, Deathmatch 1, Zeppelin vs Zeppelin 2), flags at 7 (bit 0 Score rather than Time, bit 1 Limited Lives, bit 2 Auto Respawn), minutes at 8, lives at 9, score at 10 (12 bytes) |
| `0x54` | Dogfight roster | reliable, host to each guest | round at 4, row count at 5, the reading guest's own row at 6, one reserved byte, then sixteen rows of 20 bytes: flags (bit 0 Ready, bit 1 host), airframe, two reserved bytes, the name in 16 bytes (328 bytes) |
| `0x55` | Lobby chat | reliable, guest to host and host to each guest | the speaker's name in 16 bytes at 4, the line in 84 bytes at 20 (104 bytes) |
| `0x5D` | Plane build | reliable, guest to host (its pick, seat `0xFF`) and host to each guest (every seat, at launch) | seat at 4, flags at 5 (bit 0 custom), then 26 bytes: airframe, engine, four armour presses (nose, tail, left, right), left and right hardpoints, four gun calibres (5 empty), twin mask, paint pattern, three colours, three shades, three decals, three spare; the name in 16 bytes (48 bytes) |
| `0x5E` | Plane rules | reliable, host to each guest | round at 4, flags at 5 (bit 0 Allow Custom Planes, bit 1 Outlaw Components), the outlaw list in the original's five-byte packing at 6, one reserved byte (12 bytes) |

Any option change advances the round and clears every Ready, the host's own included, so a player
is never launched on options it did not see. A guest's changed pick clears that guest's own Ready,
and the pick drops any session payload the host still holds from that guest's last match. The
launch waits until every row is Ready. A guest's
chat line goes to the host, which adds it to its own list and relays it to every other guest under
the name the guest's pick gave, so each end shows the line once. The advert's mission sequence
carries the environment index for a Dogfight, which is what the games list reads.

A custom plane crosses whole, where the original's player data leaves out the engine, the armour
and the hardpoints. The shooter decides a hit here, so every copy of a plane needs its owner's hit
volumes and armour. A guest sends its pick's build before the pick; at launch the host sends every
seat's build and fit before the session's opener, on the same ordered channel, so a guest has built
every custom plane before it reports loaded. The plane rules change the round as an option does.
The original's Ready check runs on each end for its own pick, and the host also checks every guest's
pick against its rules before counting it Ready, which the original does not. An outlawed
ammunition or rocket refuses Ready once and resets the fit, as the original does; the hardpoint
counts are kept, since the pylons stay empty either way. A co-op launch sends the host's own custom
planes, and its guests fly stock.

### LAN discovery

The games list finds hosts on the local network through `Net/LanDiscovery.cs`, a datagram pair on
UDP port 47501, the game port plus one. It is outside the carrier: no peer is connected, and no
message id is spent.

| Offset | Query | Reply |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `CSLD` | `CSLD` |
| 4 | version, 2 | version, 2 |
| 5 | kind, 1 | kind, 2 |
| 6 | two reserved bytes | two reserved bytes |
| 8 | the asker's token, 32-bit little endian | the token it answers |
| 12 | 36 zero bytes | game port, 16-bit little endian, then two reserved bytes |
| 16 | | the host's build version |
| 20 | | the host's 28-byte session advert, header included |

Both are 48 bytes. The query is padded to the reply's width so a reply is never larger than the
query that asked for it, which keeps a responder from amplifying a forged-source flood. A responder
answers only a datagram that is exactly 48 bytes with the magic, this version and the query kind,
and answers it to the address it came from. A search sends one query a round with a fresh token
and keeps only replies carrying it. The round sends that query to the limited broadcast
255.255.255.255 and to the directed broadcast (address with every host bit set) of each IPv4
network the machine sits on, once per address. Windows sends a limited broadcast out of one adapter
only, so on a machine with several adapters it can miss the host's network, while a directed
broadcast is routed out of the adapter on that network. The responder binds every interface, so a
directed broadcast on any of the host's networks reaches it. A game is listed at the reply's source address and the
port the reply names, and it leaves the list after two rounds without a reply. A game whose build
version does not play with the searcher's is listed in grey with its version in the Status
column, and Join Game refuses it with both versions named before any socket opens. The discovery
version counts layouts, not builds, so it does not change with the build version.

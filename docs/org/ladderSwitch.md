# The rope-ladder switch, decoded from `crimson.exe`

Read out of the retail executable with Ghidra (static analysis of the shipped x86 build,
`crimson.exe`, `language x86:LE:32:default`), settling `BL-526`, the CM07 rope ladder that never
deployed. Every claim names the function or address it came from; no decompiler output is
reproduced. The port is `src/Session/LadderSwitch.cs` (the rule and the state machine) and
`src/Session/LadderSwitchRuntime.cs` (the world binding).

**Where the neighbours live.** The two authored definitions the switch starts, `drop_ladder` and
`retract_ladder` in `C1/M02/zrdr/ladder.zrd`, and the pickup sensor table `pickups.zrd` are
described in [`../formats/anim-definitions/cutscenes.md`](../formats/anim-definitions/cutscenes.md).
The orientation matrix the attitude test reads is decoded in [`flightModel.md`](flightModel.md)
"Bank coupling". This page is what the original does with those: the per-frame rule, the state
machine and the callback that settles it.

⚠ **This page is a decode, not a proposal.** Where it disagrees with an observation at the
controls or a screenshot, the decode wins and the disagreement is a note.

## Nothing authored ever calls the ladder

No `.zrd` in `C1/M02` or in the shared chapter `landings.zrd` authors a `CALL_ANIMATION` of
`drop_ladder`; the name appears only as its own definition and as a `STOP_ANIMATION` /
`INVALIDATE_ANIMATION` target in the pickup-completion definition. The string `"drop_ladder"`
(`0x00627b64`) has one code reference in the whole image, in the mission initialiser
`FUN_004735b0`, and `"retract_ladder"` (`0x00627b70`) sits beside it. The ladder is driven by a
native object, not by the animation data.

`FUN_004735b0` is the ordinary per-mission initialiser (`FUN_00464680`, the mission load, calls
it under the `StructsMissionInit` progress label for every mission), not a C1/M02-only function.
What is C1/M02-specific is the authored data the object resolves: every other mission builds the
same switch, finds no definitions and no sensors, and the switch idles.

## The switch object

`FUN_004735b0` allocates a 20-byte object through `FUN_004456f0` and stores it in the global
`DAT_0071c324` (`0x00475517`); the mission teardown `FUN_00472c40` frees it (`0x00472c96`). Its
layout:

| offset | meaning |
|---|---|
| `+0x0` | vtable `0x00608084` |
| `+0x4` | state: 0 retracted, 1 deployed, 2 deploying, 3 retracting |
| `+0x8` | the `drop_ladder` definition, resolved by name through `FUN_00523820`, set by `FUN_00445500` |
| `+0xc` | the `retract_ladder` definition, resolved the same way, set by `FUN_00445540` |
| `+0x10` | the `ladder_pos` node (`FUN_00445760` on the string at `0x00623cc0`) |

The two setters also register the switch as each definition's `CALLBACK` host: `FUN_00445500`
calls `FUN_004ee160(def, LAB_004454e0, this)` and `FUN_00445540` calls
`FUN_004ee160(def, LAB_004454f0, this)`. `FUN_004ee160` writes the callback function and its
context into the definition at `+0x74`/`+0x78`, the same per-definition registration slot every
other host uses. The thunks at `0x004454e0` and `0x004454f0` forward the raised code into vtable
slots 0 and 1.

The vtable at `0x00608084`:

| slot | routine | does |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `0x00445660` | if the code is `0x7b` (123), `FUN_004454c0`: state = 1 (deployed) |
| 1 | `0x00445680` | if the code is `0x7b`, `FUN_004454d0`: state = 0 (retracted) |
| 2 | `0x004456a0` | start the drop: reads the `ladder_pos` node's position (`FUN_004cf200`) and starts the `+0x8` definition through `FUN_004edc10` with that position as its operand |
| 3 | `0x004455c0` | start the retract: `FUN_004edda0(def, 0, 0, 0, 0)` on the `+0xc` definition |

So the `CALLBACK [VALUE 123]` both definitions author (2.1 s into `drop_ladder`, 1.9 s into
`retract_ladder`) is the switch's own settle signal, and code 123 has no meaning in the
mission-script host because it was never meant for it.

### The two transitions

`FUN_004455e0` is "deploy" and `FUN_00445620` is "retract"; both are `__fastcall` on the switch:

```
deploy:  state 1            -> nothing
         state 0, no def    -> state = 1
         state 0, def       -> slot 2 (start drop); on success state = 2
         state 2 or 3       -> nothing
retract: state 0            -> nothing
         state 1, no def    -> state = 0
         state 1, def       -> slot 3 (start retract); on success state = 3
         state 2 or 3       -> nothing
```

A transient state holds until the definition's callback lands it. Losing the gate while the drop
is still playing therefore does not cancel the drop; the retract starts on the first tick after
the settle in which the gate is still lost.

## The per-frame rule

The tail of the world tick `FUN_004897c0` (`0x00489dc3`-`0x00489e21`) runs once per frame inside
the tick's outer guard (no cutscene owning the world, `DAT_0071c50c == 0`), with the player object
`DAT_0071c298` present and alive (`+0x91d == 0`) and the switch allocated:

```
if 0.707 < player[+0x190]                       ; attitude gate
   and FUN_00471690(list 0x71c268, player pos)   ; sensor gate
then deploy(switch)
else retract(switch)
```

**The attitude test.** `+0x190` is the Y component of row 1 of the aircraft's orientation matrix
at `+0x180`, and row 1 is the aircraft's own up axis in world coordinates ([`flightModel.md`](flightModel.md)
"Bank coupling", where the same component is `wingUp = m[1][1]`). The immediate at `0x006080ec`
is `0.707`. The gate is therefore "the aircraft's up axis is within 45 degrees of world up",
which bank and pitch both count against; heading plays no part. It is not measured against the
sensor or the caboose.

**The sensor test.** `FUN_00471690` is a membership walk over the global list at `0x0071c268`,
entries 8 bytes apart, `this` hard-coded at `0x00489dee`. Each entry is `{node, radius²}`, and
`FUN_004717d0` passes an entry when the node's flag word `+0x24` carries bit `0x4` (active) and
the squared distance (`FUN_00538880`) from the node's world position (`FUN_004cf2c0`) to the
player's position is at most the stored `radius²`. The position handed in is the player object's
first virtual, called at `0x00489deb`.

**Where the list comes from.** `FUN_00471830`, called by the mission load right after the
initialiser (`0x004648b5`, `this = 0x71c268`), reads `pickups.zrd` (`0x006273fc`): for each record
after the first it resolves the node named at `+0xc` by name (`FUN_004d0280(7, name)`) and, if it
exists, appends `{node, radius × radius}` (the multiply is in `FUN_00471770`). The mission
teardown `FUN_00464970` empties the list (`FUN_004716d0`). Nothing else in the image reads the
list: `pickups.zrd` exists for this switch. C1/M02's table is one row, `ladder_pickup_sensor`,
100 m.

## Consequences for the port

- The switch is a per-mission native object evaluated every tick, never an animation event: a
  `CALLBACK` handler for code 123 in the mission-script host would be wrong, and `BL-035`'s
  dropped event kinds play no role.
- The gate is two tests, in this order: `up.Y > 0.707` on the aircraft's own attitude, then
  inside any active `pickups.zrd` sensor. There is no speed band, no heading test and no
  objective gate; the sensor node's own activation (the pickup rig staging it on the caboose)
  is the only mission-side control.
- A mission without the definitions still flips the state, silently. The port keeps that so the
  switch needs no per-mission table.
- `retract_ladder` is only ever started from state 1, so a drop that is still playing is never
  cut short by the switch; the pickup-completion definition's `STOP_ANIMATION [drop_ladder]` is
  what ends it after the hookup.

## Not built

**The `ladder_roll` counter-rotation.** `FUN_004735b0` also resolves a node named `ladder_roll`
(`0x00627530`) into `DAT_0071c320`. While the switch's state is non-zero, the same tick tail
(`0x00489d42`-`0x00489dba`) decomposes the player's orientation matrix into Euler angles
(`FUN_0053df30`), rebuilds a rotation from them with the middle angle zeroed
(`FUN_0053f610(0, e0, e2)`), converts it back (`FUN_0053f8d0`, `FUN_0053fa40`, `FUN_0053df30`)
and writes the result as the node's rotation (`FUN_004d1a30`). Read as: the ladder's hanging
frame is counter-rotated by the aircraft's pitch and roll so it hangs plumb, heading left alone.
In C1/M02 the node is authored inside the `rope_ladder` actor
(`mis_anim/rope_ladder-cabpkup_ladder.json`). The port does not do this yet; the rungs' authored
`ladder_drop.zan` motion plays under the aircraft's own frame.

**The `ladder_pickup` mission flag.** `FUN_004a3a60`, the mission-record parser, sets a byte at
record `+0x22` when the record carries `ladder_pickup` (`0x006296b0`). Its reader is not traced
in this pass; it is not part of the switch above.

**What starts `pickup_timing`.** Not this list, and not the player: the chapter's `train.zrd`
definition `train_on_track`, a `NEW_GAME_START` anim, opens with `CALL_ANIMATION [pickup_timing]`
before its track loops, so the timing runs from mission load on the train's own clock
([`../formats/anim-definitions/cutscenes.md`](../formats/anim-definitions/cutscenes.md)). The port
runs it the same way and starts nothing off the sensor.

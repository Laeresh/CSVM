# Menu presentations: the contract and the extension checklist

How the in-game menu is split between shared features and interchangeable presentations, what a
new presentation (a Modern one, say) plugs into, and what it must not assume it inherits from the
two that ship. The per-module detail is routed from [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) into
[`architecture/UI.md`](architecture/UI.md), one `##` entry per file named below; this page is the
seam read as a whole. The screen census and the evidence behind
the Original presentation are [`org/menu-inventory.md`](org/menu-inventory.md); the decoded layout
format is [`formats/menu-layout.md`](formats/menu-layout.md).

## What a presentation is, and is not

A menu presentation is a screen graph together with its navigation, interaction, animation and cue
selection over the shared features. Drawing alone is not the boundary: the two shipped
presentations, Built-in (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/BuiltIn/`, the launchscreen in `CSVM/src/UI/LaunchMenu.cs`)
and Original (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/Original/`, the decoded 800x600 screens over the player's extracted
menu data), reach the same features through different screen sequences, different input idioms
(cursor rows against a pointer-first page) and different sounds.

A presentation is not where play is configured, validated, persisted or launched. Those are the
shared features' operations, and a presentation only decides how to offer them. It never
constructs a session, never names a launcher type, never hides itself, and never reads a device: it
reads semantic commands from the host's seats and leaves through one typed exit.

Built-in is permanent. It is the fallback every unavailable request resolves to, it needs no
extracted menu artwork to be usable, and every other presentation is additive beside it.

## Registration

`PresentationRegistry` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/PresentationRegistry.cs`) holds one factory per
`PresentationId`, a non-empty ordinal token that Options persist as written. `Launcher.BuildMenuHost`
(`CSVM/src/Session/Launcher.cs`) fills the registry once per process:

```
registry.Register(PresentationId.BuiltIn,  () => new BuiltInPresentation(...));
registry.Register(PresentationId.Original, () => new OriginalPresentation(...));
```

Registration says what exists in the build, nothing more. A second registration of the same id
throws, since two rivals for one identity is a wiring error. The host asks the registry for a fresh
instance on every activation after a switch, which is what makes a switch discard transient
presentation state by construction. The factories run inside the first `Show`, so a factory may
read process state the launcher settled by then (the cold start's `--menu=` aid, the layout the
availability check loaded).

## The lifecycle and the host

`IMenuPresentation` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/IMenuPresentation.cs`) has four calls and an identity:

| Member | When the host calls it | What the presentation does |
|---|---|---|
| `Id` | never; read by the host and the tests | the token it registered under |
| `Activate(host, destination)` | on the cold start, after every `Hide`, and once after a switch (always with `TopLevel`) | builds its nodes on the first call, then stands on the screen of its own graph that the destination maps to |
| `Tick(dt)` | every frame while shown | polls the host's seats, drives its graph, requests cues, hands an exit to the host |
| `Hide()` | after the host consumed an exit | takes itself off screen and keeps its state; a flight is not a switch, and the next `Activate` lands on the screens as they were left |
| `Deactivate()` | the first half of a switch | tears down everything `Activate` built; the instance is discarded afterwards |

`IMenuHost` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/IMenuHost.cs`) is what a presentation borrows between `Activate` and
`Deactivate` and keeps no reference to past that: `Features` (the shared `MenuFeatureSet`), `Audio`
(the shared `IMenuAudio`), `Seats` (one `IMenuInputSource` per joined seat, a live list) and
`Exit(MenuExit)`, the only way out. The implementation is `MenuHost` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/MenuHost.cs`),
engine-free, owned by `Launcher` for the life of the process. `Launcher` shows it with a destination
on every entry, ticks it every frame, and receives every exit through the sink it constructed the
host with. `MenuHost.Shown` is what the owner reads for "the menu is up"; no presentation's node is
consulted.

A switch is three host calls in order: `Deactivate()` (ends the instance and calls
`Features.DiscardTransient()`), `Select(...)` (re-resolves from the saved request), then
`Show(TopLevel)`. `Launcher.ApplyOptions` performs them one frame after the
`OptionsApplyExit` that asked for them, after saving every choice it carries.

The frame in between belongs to no presentation: the host hides the outgoing one as it hands the
exit to the sink, and the incoming one does not stand up until the apply runs. Nothing opaque is
over the persistent `WorldEnvironment` on that frame, so `Launcher.ShowMenu` blacks its background
through `Utils/WorldBackdrop.cs` and a launch puts the sky back. A presentation still draws its own
opaque backdrop: the black is what the switch's own frame, and the held frame after a quit, fall
back to.

## The shared features

`MenuFeatureSet` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/MenuFeatureSet.cs`) holds one instance of each feature, fetched
by concrete type (`Get<T>`, `TryGet<T>`), outliving every switch. A feature implements `IMenuFeature`
(`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/IMenuFeature.cs`): typed state plus semantic operations for one area of play, and
`Discard()`, which drops unfinished setup when the active presentation changes and touches nothing
persisted. There is no universal row, button or picture schema; each presentation reads a feature's
concrete members and composes them its own way.

| Feature | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| `FreeFlightFeature` | the chapter roster it offers, the chapter pick, the launch gate over the setup's seats, `BuildExit` | seats, aircraft, stores |
| `InstantActionFeature` | every decoded option set, the environment, mission type, lives, four waves, wingmen and their fit, the player plane, presets, the base def, `BuildExit` | which screens the fields appear on, the wizard order |
| `PlayerSetupFeature` | the seats claimed by input-source identity (four at most, seat 0 never leaving), the aircraft roster (`BuildRoster`), each seat's cursor, the two-stage pick and its fit, the per-mode gate, `Choices`, `BuildExit` for Dogfight | the pad behind a seat (asked of the presentation through `MenuSeatDevices`), the join gesture, the split-pane or seat-strip drawing |
| `HangarFeature` | one scratch build at a time over a `CustomPlaneStore` and an optional `IHangarWallet`, the three starts, the airframe pick with the defaults ask, the per-tab operations, the purchase gate in the original's words, `Commit`, `DeleteSaved`, the labels and name rules | the nine-screen walk or the tab bar, the dropdowns, the dialog idiom |
| `ControlsFeature` | the seats it can edit and their staged keymaps, the context and action cursors, the capture and the steal it names first, `Accept`, `Cancel`, `ResetSeat` | which page the rows are split across, the tabs or columns they are drawn in, the join that raises a second seat's row |
| `CampaignFeature` | the profile store, roster and seated profile, `ContinuePlayer` and `DeletePlayer` with their refusals, the mission position and its briefing state and reveal progress, the intents between screens, `CommitLoadout`, `CommitPlanes`, `ExportPlane`, the flight field, the wallet, `BuildExit` | the screen stack, the cursor, the refusal line, the modal, the working copies before ACCEPT, the reveal's clock |

The rule that makes two presentations replaceable: a feature never references a presentation, and
the dependency test rejects one that does (below). A feature also never reads a device: seat 0's
pointer, a pad's Start, the keyboard's letters all arrive as semantic commands.

Two shared readers sit beside the features in the same namespace and follow the same rule:
`MenuLayout` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/MenuLayout.cs`), the reader of `extracted/rof/menu_layout.json`, and
`MenuChapters`, the chapter roster. `CampaignAidProfiles` is the scratch profile store the campaign
screenshot aids read, so both presentations' aids seat one player and none can reach
`user://Profiles`.

## Input sources and seats

`IMenuInputSource` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/MenuCommands.cs`) is one seat's source: `Poll(dt)` returns
that frame's `MenuCommands`, `Prime()` seeds edge detection so a button held from before the menu
showed is not a fresh press, `CapturingText` says whether typed characters feed a text field, and
`DeviceLabel` names the device for a join strip. `MenuCommands` is already device-neutral: `MoveY`
and `MoveX` with auto-repeat applied, the edges `Accept`, `Back`, `Join`, `Loadout`, `Contents`,
`Erase`, the `Typed` characters, and an optional `MenuPointer` (window pixels, `Pressed`, `Clicked`
on the press edge, `Wheel` as the steps turned since the last poll and positive toward a list's
foot; null when the seat's devices have none). A presentation reads meaning and never a key, button
or axis.

The shipped sources: `BuiltInSeat` wraps one `MenuInput` (seat 0's reads the keyboard plus every
unclaimed pad; a joined seat's reads its one pad); `PointerSeat` wraps a seat and adds the mouse as
its pointer through three injected delegates; `MenuIdleSource` is a seat with no device, what the
`--debug-join=` aid seats. A source is not synonymous with a pad, and a later flight-control binding
plugs in as another `IMenuInputSource` with no change to any presentation.

The seats themselves are the `PlayerSetupFeature`'s. Once that feature is registered,
`MenuHost.Seats` is its live source list, `MenuHost.AddSeat` joins through it, and a join made
anywhere shows up in every presentation's `Seats` read. The pad side (`MenuSeatDevices`,
`CSVM/src/UI/MenuSeatDevices.cs`) is presentation-side and shared by both: seat 0's claimed pad,
hotplug reconciliation, the Start-to-join scan (each presentation decides on which screens it is
open), and `FlightPads`, the binding a launch carries per seat. Both presentations call
`ClaimP1Pad` every frame while joining is closed (Built-in off its Plane screen, Original wherever
`OriginalShell.JoiningOpen` is false), so the pad seat 0 steers with is seat 0's for good and can
never join as a further seat. Original opens joining on the four screens that launch a flight
(Free Flight, Dogfight, Instant Action and the campaign flight check) and, once a second seat has
joined, draws the sortie screens' seat strip over every campaign board and over the Instant Action
screen as an overlay in the desk margin; a solo campaign shows the authored board alone. A
presentation with a pointer maps the window-pixel pointer into its own space; Original does it
through the same `BoardFit` its board view draws with. Built-in reads no `MenuPointer` at all: its rows are Godot
`Control`s, so player 1's rows take Godot's own hit test through `gui_input` (`LaunchMenu.Pointable`)
and fold the mouse into the next frame's commands (a hover is the cursor step onto that row, a
press and release on one row is that step plus Accept in one frame, a wheel notch is a step, a
right-button press is Back on every screen but Mode, where Back is the quit; the frame's own step
outranks a hover, so a pad and the mouse cannot each own a row). The centred
layout's lists, the hangar pages and player 1's pane on a split aircraft screen are pointable;
the campaign boards under Built-in are one composed surface and stay on the keys and pads.

Under Original a seat picks its aircraft on a screen of its own, not down a list every seat shares.
Seat 0 picks on the sortie screen or in the Instant Action Pilot Plane row; then each joined seat in
player order gets the per-seat aircraft screen (`OriginalSeatPlane.cs`), the campaign plane-selection
board's shape over the sortie roster, where Accept selects and a second Accept confirms. Back and
CANCEL SELECTIONS each take back a selection, and over the open list each leaves the walk for the
screen it came from with every seat kept, so no press on that screen unjoins: a pilot leaves the
sortie with Back on the Instant Action screen or with their device. Joining stays closed on that
screen. The last seat's confirm is the launch, on either sortie screen as on Instant Action, so seat
0's pick is the ready and the walk is the launch; where FLY's own gate is unmet (Dogfight without a
second seat, a sortie with no map picked) the screen the walk came from returns instead with FLY to
press, FLY going live only when every joined seat is Confirmed. Over a selection the screen also
offers WEAPON LOADOUT, which opens the loadout chrome on that seat's own fit and airframe and
returns to the picker, so every joined pilot picks weapons as well as an aeroplane and the choice
rides that seat's own `Fit` into the launch; the original has no second pilot, so this is a remake
decision and not fidelity. The picking seat's own device drives that screen and the Weapon Loadout
it opens, and the mouse, which rides seat 0's source and is the one device a pilot without a pad of their own
can pick with; seat 0's stick, buttons and keyboard move nothing there, `StepSeat` reducing seat 0's
frame to its pointer while another seat picks. CANCEL SELECTIONS is therefore the pointer's own Back,
its second press leaving the walk once there is no selection left to drop. Nothing on that screen is
decoded.

The wheel and the thumb reach the lists through one seam. `OriginalShell.Lists` answers the screen's
scrolling lists as `OriginalList` records, topmost first, each a key, a `ListWindow`
(`CSVM/src/UI/ListWindow.cs`) the list widget built from its own geometry, and the write that puts
the window's first row somewhere else. Nothing is listed under a dialog, and while a drop-down is
open its list is the only one, since it hangs over the screen. Per frame the shell takes the thumb
first (a held thumb owns the pointer until it is let go, and the click that took hold activates
nothing under it), then a wheel step over the list the pointer stands in, then re-reads the rows and
hit-tests. A write that moves a window also pulls the focus to the window's nearer edge when it
stood on a row the move would hide, because the window otherwise follows the focus straight back.
The arrows and the keyboard do not go through any of this, so the wheel is an addition on top of the
decoded screens rather than a change to them. Original's mouse is the only one that reaches a list
this way; Built-in's rows are Godot controls and take the wheel through `gui_input`, as above.

The windows themselves are the list widgets': `CampaignBoards.ComboWindow` for an open campaign
drop-down, `CampaignPreviousMissionsPage.PointerWindow` for the scrapbook's contents page, and
Original's own for the hangar's dropdowns, Instant Action's dropdowns and contents window, and the
sortie screens' aircraft column. An open dropdown on Instant Action shows at most the authored
`TotalDisplayed` rows and keeps every item as a row keyed `<key>:<index>`, drawn and hit only inside
the window, so a scripted pose and a suite walk still pick by index whatever the window shows.

## Options, selection and availability

`OptionsStore` (`CSVM/src/Utils/OptionsStore.cs`) is the one process-wide options file,
`user://options.json`, independent of any profile: version-tolerant (an unknown version invalidates
the file, an unknown value drops only that field, a field the file does not carry reads as never
set), read as empty when missing or malformed, written atomically. Its word-valued fields are
`menuPresentation` (`built-in`, `original`), `graphicsMode` (`original`, `enhanced`), `difficulty`
(`normal`, `hard`, `hardest`), `displayMode` (`windowed`, `borderless`, `fullscreen`) and `vsync`
(`on`, `off`, `60`, `120`, `144`); a value outside a field's set reads as never set. Two fields are
not words: `monitorIndex` is a screen index rendered decimal and `resolution` is a canonical
`1920x1080`, both validated by shape, so a malformed one is dropped the same way an unknown word is.
The four volume levels (`audioMaster`, `audioMusic`, `audioEffects`, `audioVoice`) are whole numbers
on `AudioMix`'s 0..100 and are validated by range, dropped the same way again.
Shape is all the store can prove. Whether that screen is plugged in and whether it offers that mode
are questions for the caller holding an engine, which owns the fallback.

**An option is a store field plus a row in each presentation's Options screen.** Adding one means
a nullable field on `OptionsDef` with its accepted-value set (or its shape check, and the canonical
form beside it so the writing and validating sides cannot drift), the two writes in `Serialize` and
`Deserialize`, a row in Built-in's Options screen and an entry in the table Original's Game Options,
AUDIO or VIDEO page draws its rows from, a value on `OptionsApplyExit`, and the line in
`Launcher.ApplyOptions` that saves it. The store's
`Version` does not move for a new field: a missing field already reads as never set, so a file
written before the field existed loads with everything it does have, and the version gate is
reserved for a field whose meaning or shape changed. Whichever module consumes the option decides
what "never set" falls back to and where the saved value sits among its other sources; for the
graphics mode that is `GraphicsMode.Resolve`, where the `--graphics=` flag beats the saved option,
which beats the `graphics.mode` config key (`docs/cli.md`); for the difficulty it is
`SessionSpec.WithSavedDifficulty`, applied by `Launcher.LaunchSession` at every launch, where a
parsed `--difficulty=` flag beats the saved word, a `--det` run reads no saved option, and the
default is `normal`. For the V-Sync choice it is `VSyncSetting.Resolve`, where `--no-vsync` beats
the saved word, which beats the `display.vsync` config key, which beats V-Sync off, and for the
display mode `DisplayModeSetting.Resolve`, where the saved word beats the borderless default and
there is no flag or config key above it. The window size is `ResolutionSetting.Resolve`, the same
two layers over the chosen screen's own size, with the extra rule that the saved size has to be one
that screen offers: a size it does not offer falls back to the screen's size rather than to the
nearest, since every other option falls through to its own default and a nearest match would hand
the player an aspect ratio they did not pick. The screen is `MonitorSetting.Resolve`, the one setting
whose saved value can name something that is not there: an index no screen answers to is dropped like an
unknown word and the window stays on the screen it already stands on, which is the primary on a launch
that has moved nothing. A display setting is also the case where the apply does
more than save, since `Launcher.ApplyOptions` puts the chosen pacing, mode and size on the window
there and then rather than at the next start. Those calls run in the order the window needs them: the
screen the window sits on first, since a mode applied before the move would fill the screen the
window is leaving, then the mode, then the size, then the pacing. The startup half of the pair is not
symmetric: the pacing is applied on every launch, the mode and the size only on a session someone is
at, a scripted run's window being hidden off screen with its capture compared against the viewport
`project.godot` pins.

A screen never writes the store. Both values ride the exit and `Launcher.ApplyOptions` is the only
writer, so the options file has exactly one, and no test or suite that drives an Options screen
through Apply can write the player's own file. Nor read it: `--run-tests` points
`OptionsStore.UserOptions()` at an emptied scratch directory (`OptionsStore.DirectoryOverride`)
before any suite runs, so every driven Options screen opens on the shipped defaults whatever the
player last saved at the controls.

`PresentationResolution` (`CSVM/src/Utils/PresentationResolution.cs`) fixes the precedence:
`--force-builtin`, then `--presentation=<token>`, then the saved request, then Built-in. Availability
is checked after the request is picked and never rewrites it, so what Options show back
(`MenuHost.Requested`) is what the player asked for even when `MenuHost.Selected` is Built-in.

`MenuHost.Select(forceBuiltIn, cliOverride, savedRequest)` answers availability as registration plus
the owner's `Availability` delegate, a function from `PresentationId` to a reason or null. Built-in
is never asked. `Launcher.OriginalAvailable` is the shipped delegate: it loads the decoded layout
through `OriginalAvailability.Load`, which refuses a tree stamped behind
`OriginalAssetManifest.StampSchema`, a missing or unreadable layout, a layout with no `[MainMenu]`,
and any required file the manifest names as missing or unreadable, each with one reason the host
appends to its fallback reason and logs. The delegate is asked on every process start and on every
switch, so a tree repaired while the process is up is seen by the next switch; a return from flight
never re-selects.

Every presentation exposes Options, since a player must be able to leave a presentation from inside
it. Built-in's is the Mode screen's Options row (`--menu=options`); Original's is the Game Options
page behind its Preferences page's first door (`--menu=game-options` under
`--presentation=original`), with the graphics mode on the VIDEO page behind the third
(`--menu=video`), the four volume levels on the AUDIO page behind the second
(`--menu=audio`) and the keymap on the CONTROLS page behind the fourth (`--menu=controls`, and
`--menu=keys` for the KEYS AND BUTTONS page behind its own door). Built-in's one screen carries
every setting Original spreads over those pages bar the volume levels, its rows in its own stepper
convention: the difficulty, the presentation and the graphics mode, then the monitor, the window
size, the display mode and the V-Sync choice. The two presentations read those four through one rule
set (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/DisplaySettingRows.cs`) over the same per-machine enumerations, so a saved
value cannot read one way on the VIDEO page and another on Built-in's screen. Every option page reads the saved options from the store on entry and leaves
through an `OptionsApplyExit` carrying every choice, whichever page it was sent from, so the store
keeps its one writer. Both presentation choosers offer the
two shipped tokens alone, so a third presentation extends them as well as the registry (checklist
below); both graphics choosers cover `original` and `enhanced` and say in their description that
the choice takes effect on the next start, since the mode is resolved once at launch and applying
it rebuilds nothing; while the choice differs from the running mode the description names the
running mode and says a restart is still owed, read off `GraphicsMode.Enhanced`. The
startup recovery is `--force-builtin`, which beats everything and rewrites nothing.

**What an Options page focuses with, and what it draws focus as.** Two choices on these pages are
not derivable from the layout, because the authored data offers a plausible wrong answer for each.

The focused row takes the file-wide `ACTIVE`, not the page title's colour. The Preferences page
authors a title colour that is a duller grey than the description cream every unfocused row is
written in, so a row focused with the title colour reads as the disabled one, inverting the page.
`ACTIVE` is what every other Original screen already focuses with, so taking it keeps this family
from being the one that dims what it highlights. The rest of the palette does come from the page:
the description colour for row text, the title colour for the heading, and the paper plaque's label
tail for the chooser.

A slider's focus is the focus box and the wash under it, because the thumb art carries one frame
with no focused or pressed state. The box is the readable half. The wash lands over a widened press
region around a three-pixel slot, so on its own it is a faint band over mostly background; it stays
only because the box needs a region to enclose, and without it the outline reads as four loose
lines. Where neither piece of art is measurable both stand as rectangles, the way a missing plaque
leaves an outlined label, so the control still shows its level. The box is a focus mark rather than
standing chrome, so exactly one row carries it: drawn on every row it becomes a permanent hard box
around rectangles the layout authors at differing widths.

## Audio

`IMenuAudio` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/IMenuAudio.cs`): `Cue(MenuCue)` plays one semantic cue by name,
`BeginNarration(wavName)` starts spoken narration, replacing any playing and ducking the music,
`EndNarration()` stops it, idempotent, and `PreviewMix(levels, moved)`/`EndMixPreview()` carry the
mix a page that sets one stands at. The presentation chooses which cue to ask for and when; the
service (`MenuAudioService`, `CSVM/src/Session/MenuAudioService.cs`) owns lookup, decoding,
playback, volume, the buses and the handoff into a launching session. A cue name the table lacks, a
missing file or a failed decode is logged once and cached as silence; a presentation never learns
whether a sound exists.

**The bus model and the four levels.** The process runs four audio buses, shipped as
`CSVM/default_bus_layout.tres`: Master, with Music, Effects and Voice sending into it. Every site
that builds a player names its category at construction (`Utils/AudioBuses.cs`), because Godot
resolves an unknown bus name to Master with no error and a misplaced player is otherwise silent
about it; the `audio-buses` suite walks the live tree and fails on any player left on Master. The
AUDIO page carries four levels on 0..100, Master, Music, Effects and Voice, and a fresh install
opens on 100, 50, 50 and 50, the authored `CurrentValue` of the three category rows and full on the
added one. `Utils/AudioMix.cs` turns them into one gain per category bus, `category/100 x
master/100`, so Master is a multiplier over the other three rather than a level of its own.

**Bus 0 is not part of that mix.** It carries the developer gain alone, `--volume=` over the
`audio.volume` key over silence in a repo run (`Utils/MasterVolume.cs`), and `AudioMix` refuses to
write index 0 by construction. The two gains therefore reach the output as a product: `--volume=0`
still silences a scripted run whatever the saved levels say, a full-volume launch still leaves bus 0
untouched, and a `--det` launch reads no saved level at all and mixes the shipped defaults. The
`audio-levels-launch` suite drives that ladder from a parsed command line, since a screenshot proves
nothing about audio and a golden sweep cannot see the `--det` drop fail
([verification.md](verification.md)'s INSTR-45 and DET-14).

**The mix preview.** While a page that sets the four volume levels is open, it states them every
frame and names which one that frame moved (`MenuMixLevel`, the page's own rows and never a bus).
The service applies them through `AudioMix` and sounds the moved category on a player of its own:
Effects over `SFX_LOOP.WAV` and Voice over `VOICE_LOOP.WAV`, the two of the original's three preview
clips this port needs, since Music and Master are already audible through the menu's own score. A
clip that is still running is left to run, its loudness following the bus the level moved, so a drag
sounds one clip rather than one per frame. `EndMixPreview` puts back the gains that stood when the
page opened and is called on every door out of the page and on `Hide`, so a preview cannot survive
the page; an accepted mix is written and reapplied by `Launcher.ApplyOptions`, which stays the
options file's one writer. ⚠ Previews are off in any run that drives itself (`--det`,
`--run-tests`, `--screenshot`), so a scripted run's mix cannot become a function of a menu walk.

**A clip on the move is a deliberate departure.** The original's own page
(`extracted/rof/ASSETS/SCRIPTS/AUDIO.SCRIPT`) builds one sound object per category on `gui_create`,
starts them there, sends only `setvolume` as a slider moves and stops all three on `gui_destroy`;
no play message reaches a category's object on a move. This port fires a clip on the level that
moved instead, so a slider is audible at the moment the player touches it rather than only while
something happens to be running. Whether the original's clips loop or play once is undecodable from
the script: `ZB = 0` stands on every `@ctl@SK` object the shipped scripts build, including
`GLOBALS.SCRIPT`'s menu music, which plays on while the menu is up, so the field settles nothing.
Film of the original is the only thing that would.

The cue table (`MenuCueTable`, `CSVM/src/Session/MenuCueTable.cs`) resolves the four names the
original's globals script binds: `menu.rollover`, `menu.click`, `menu.text`, `menu.text-error`, each
to a wav under the extracted rof tree's `ASSETS/SOUNDS`. Original asks for all four
(`OriginalCues`); Built-in asks for none and uses the service for briefing narration alone. A new
presentation may request these names or add its own to the table; the wavs it resolves to must come
from the player's extraction or from assets the repository may ship. Narration is begun by
whichever presentation shows a briefing and ended by it on every door out and in `Hide`; the
service knows nothing of which screen is up.

## Launch

`MenuExit` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/MenuExit.cs`) is the one way out, handed to `IMenuHost.Exit` and
consumed by `Launcher.OnMenuExit`. The hierarchy is closed:

| Exit | Carries | The consumer's action |
|---|---|---|
| `LaunchExit` | chapter, one `MenuSeatChoice` per seat, `MenuMode`, an `InstantActionDef` for Instant Action | derive the session spec from the CLI plus the payload, bind the seats' pads, build |
| `CampaignMissionExit` | the profile name, the `cm_sequence` position, one `MenuSeatChoice` per joined human | the same, over the campaign's story position |
| `QuitExit` | nothing | quit the process |
| `OptionsApplyExit` | the requested `PresentationId`, the graphics-mode and difficulty words, and the four display settings | save every one of them, then the three-call switch one frame later |

`MenuSeatChoice` is the plane node, the pad devices the seat claimed, the fit and, for a saved
custom plane, its resolved `CustomPlaneDef`; the consumer never reads a store. The features build
these exits (`FreeFlightFeature.BuildExit`, `InstantActionFeature.BuildExit`,
`PlayerSetupFeature.BuildExit`, `CampaignFeature.BuildExit`), so a presentation assembles no payload
of its own beyond handing the feature the seats. The host hides the presentation before the sink
runs, and a failed build shows the same instance again where it stood.

## Return

`MenuReturnDestination` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/MenuReturnDestination.cs`) is where the player stands
when the menu comes back, said semantically; the hierarchy is closed:

| Destination | Raised by | Built-in lands on | Original lands on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TopLevel` | the cold start, the boards' Exit, a failed build, every switch | the Mode screen with its cursors kept | the top level with its list cursors kept and every pick dropped |
| `CabinReturn(profile)` | leaving a campaign screen for the cabin | the cabin over the named profile, re-read from the presentation's store | the same, through its own campaign graph |
| `DebriefReturn(profile, missionSeq)` | a campaign mission's end, won or lost | the scrapbook on the flown mission | the book on the flown mission |

A destination names where the player stands and never a store or a screen id. The store a profile
is re-read from is the presentation's own (`user://Profiles`, or the scratch store a suite sets), and
a destination a graph lacks maps to the nearest one it has, with a logged warning when a named
profile cannot be read. The `--menu=` aid is not a destination: it reaches the cold start alone (the
launcher parks it, the factory reads it, the first `Show` consumes it), so a return after a flight is
always one of the three above and never the aid's screen again.

## The asset policy

Built-in is usable with no extracted menu artwork: where it draws extracted art (the campaign
boards, the hangar's blueprints) it degrades to its hardcoded chrome or to no picture, and it never
refuses to run.

Original is gated before entry. `OriginalAssetManifest` (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/Original/OriginalAssetManifest.cs`)
derives its classification from the decoded layout on every start: the art of the sections
Original composes is required, less two short tables (rows it never draws, and rows it draws whose
file the screen survives the absence of, which today is the two background movies); every other
section's art, those rows' art and the media a script names are optional; the files the scripts name
and Original draws anyway (the two pointers, the font, the two export plaques) are required. `Check`
reads no bitmap (existence plus the PNG signature and header size for required entries, existence
alone for optional ones) and answers one report naming every fault with its section, row and file.
A required fault makes the presentation unavailable and Built-in runs with the reason logged; an
optional absence is logged once and degrades where it is drawn (a row with no readable strip keeps
a fallback rectangle and no picture). The manifest's `StampSchema` is the extraction stamp's own
schema (`ExtractionStamp.Schema`, recorded in `extracted/VERSION.json`), so a tree extracted before
the layout decode, or before the movies were copied into it, is refused with the re-extract
instruction rather than read as empty or opened on a menu with nothing running behind it; the
extractor re-stamps an existing tree without re-extracting it.

The classification is reconciled against what the screens draw: `OriginalCoverageTests` collects
every screen-chrome name its journeys draw and fails any the manifest classes optional. Movies are
outside that reconciliation on purpose, being the one thing a screen draws and survives without. No game asset enters
the repository; every test over real data is an `[ExtractedDataFact]` that skips when the extraction
is absent, and every fixture is hand-authored.

## The namespace seam and the scans

Shared contracts, features and readers live in the namespace `CSVM.UI.Menu` exactly (folder
`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/`). Each presentation lives in a sub-namespace (`CSVM.UI.Menu.BuiltIn`,
`CSVM.UI.Menu.Original`) and may depend on anything, `Godot` included. `ComposedBoard`, `BoardFit`
and the other board types stay presentation-side in `CSVM.UI`.

Two scans over the compiled metadata enforce it (`CSVM.Tests/MenuNamespaceDependencyTests.cs`,
through `AssemblyDependencyScan`, which walks signatures and method-body IL alike without loading
the assembly):

- no type in `CSVM.UI.Menu` references `Godot.*` or any `CSVM.UI.*` type outside that exact
  namespace, which is what keeps every feature free of both presentations and of the engine;
- nothing in `CSVM.UI` or any `CSVM.UI.Menu*` namespace names `GameSession`, `Launcher` or
  `LauncherContext`, which is what keeps every presentation from building a session or reaching
  the launcher.

The scanner's own fixtures prove it sees a signature-level and a body-only reference, and a scan
matching no types fails rather than passing. A new presentation's namespace falls under the second
scan automatically; anything it adds to the shared namespace falls under the first.

## The `--menu=` aid convention

`--menu=<value>` opens the cold start on one screen for a `--screenshot`, and its values belong to
the active presentation: every value in [`cli.md`](cli.md)'s bullet is Built-in's unless
`--presentation=original` is set, in which case the same flag carries Original's own values
(`free-flight`, `dogfight`, `instant-action`, `instant-action:pilot-plane` with its Pilot Plane
list open and `instant-action:weapon-loadout` on the pilot's loadout screen, `options`,
`game-options` and `game-options:open` with its Difficulty list standing open, `audio` and
`audio:mixed` with its four sliders at four distinct levels, `video`,
`video:checked` with its Enhanced Graphics box ticked and `video:open` with its Resolution list
standing open, the one leaf list whose sizes can outrun the window its row authors,
`controls`, `keys` and `keys:other` with
the KEYS AND BUTTONS page standing on the one category that outruns its list window, `credits` and
`credits:about` with the About box standing over it, the
`plane-*` hangar poses with `plane-construction:open` standing the airframe list open on a row the
hub's figures preview, `plane-construction:overweight` on a build past its capacity and
`plane-paint:decals` standing the nose decal picker open as its five-across grid, `campaign`
and the shared scratch-store campaign poses, `campaign-delete`), and any other value opens that 
presentation's top level. Built-in's values and output stay stable whatever presentation is added.

A new presentation's aids follow the same rules: they select a screen of its own graph, they never
write into `user://Profiles` or `user://Planes` (the campaign poses read `CampaignAidProfiles`'
scratch store; a hangar pose commits nothing), the one door onto the real profile store is the value
`campaign` (`CampaignAidProfiles.PlayerDoor`), each value is documented in `cli.md`'s `--menu=`
bullet under its presentation, and no flag is added, so `cli.md`'s flag index and the parser's count
stay equal. An aid reaches the cold start alone and is consumed on the first `Activate`.

## What a new presentation does not inherit from Original

Original's fidelity choices are Original's, and a presentation registered beside it starts from
the contract above, not from Original's code. In particular it does not inherit:

- **The decoded layout and the 800x600 authored space.** `MenuLayout`, the layout sections, the
  widget rows, the four-frame button strips and their measured sizes are Original's evidence base.
  A new presentation may read `MenuLayout` or ignore it entirely; nothing in the host requires a
  decoded geometry.
- **The 4:3 board fit.** `BoardFit`'s uniform fit, centring and letterboxing, and the nearest
  sampling of extracted art, are the rule for screens composed in the original's coordinate space.
  A presentation that lays out for the window's own aspect owes `BoardFit` nothing.
- **The remake-only screens and rules.** Original's Free Flight and Dogfight doors and screens, its
  wallet-free hangar entry and Weapon Loadout screen behind the Instant Action screen's two buttons,
  the words and control kinds its Game Options rows take, the seven category tabs its KEYS AND
  BUTTONS page splits this port's three keymaps across, its keyboard and pad focus over a
  pointer-driven original, and its pointer hotspot are
  readings recorded in the inventory as remake-only. A new
  presentation makes its own choices for the same operations and records them the same way.
- **The pointer bitmaps and the cue names.** The two extracted pointer bitmaps and the four cue
  names are what Original draws and asks for. A presentation with a pointer draws whatever it
  likes; one with sounds asks the service for names of its own or reuses these.
- **The shared campaign board component.** Original hosts Built-in's campaign pages inside its own
  graph (`CampaignBoards.For` over a `CampaignFlow` of its own, mirroring the screen and row) so the
  campaign screens look the same in both. That is a choice, not a requirement: a new presentation
  may compose the campaign feature's state its own way, and the classification of what is shared
  (`CampaignFeature`) against what is presentation-side (the stack, the cursor, the refusal line,
  the modal, the working copies, the reveal's clock) is what it reads to decide.
- **The asset manifest's classification.** The required set is derived from what Original
  composes. A new presentation that needs extracted art supplies its own availability answer
  (below) and its own required set; one that ships no extracted art is available whenever it is
  registered, like Built-in.
- **Original's `--menu=` values.** The aid names are per presentation; a new one mints its own.

What it does inherit, and may rely on: the features and their operations, the seats and their
semantic commands, the audio service and its narration handoff, the store and the resolution rule,
the four exits and the three destinations, the debug-join seating of device-less players, and the
launcher's whole leg (spec derivation, pad binding, the build, the failed-build return, the
frame-deferred switch).

## The extension checklist

In order. Each step names the file it touches and the test that proves it.

1. **Mint the identity.** Add a `PresentationId` token beside `BuiltIn` and `Original`
   (`CSVM/src/UI/Menu/PresentationId.cs`), and add the same string to `OptionsStore`'s accepted set
   (`CSVM/src/Utils/OptionsStore.cs`), or the saved request will read as never set. Extend
   `OptionsStoreTests` with the new token round-tripping.
2. **Create the namespace.** `CSVM/src/UI/Menu/<Name>/`, namespace `CSVM.UI.Menu.<Name>`. Put every
   node, drawing type and screen graph there; put nothing in `CSVM.UI.Menu` that is not shared by
   every presentation. `MenuNamespaceDependencyTests` covers the new namespace with no edit.
3. **Write the screen graph engine-free first.** Original's shape is a shell class over the
   features (`OriginalShell`) driven by `MenuCommands` frames and composing a picture, with a thin
   node (`OriginalPresentation`) that polls the seats, maps the pointer and draws. The shell
   unit-tests with no engine; write those tests against a hand-authored fixture, never against the
   player's data.
4. **Implement `IMenuPresentation`.** `Activate` builds on the first call and maps all three
   destinations (a destination the graph lacks maps to the nearest it has, logged); `Tick` polls
   `host.Seats` every frame (the list is live), sets each seat's `CapturingText` while a text field
   shows, and hands every exit to `host.Exit`; `Hide` keeps state and ends any narration;
   `Deactivate` frees everything. Apply the cold start's aid on the first `Activate` only.
5. **Offer every shared feature's operations.** Free Flight, Instant Action, Dogfight through the
   player setup, the hangar and the campaign, each reached from the presentation's top level and
   each with a way back that lands on the top level with no open campaign, build or dialog behind
   it. Write a coverage test in `OriginalCoverageTests`' shape: every screen reached and left by
   every input family the presentation supports, every exit typed.
6. **Expose Options.** A screen that reads the saved options from `OptionsStore`, offers every
   registered token and every option the store carries, and leaves through `OptionsApplyExit`.
   Generalise the two shipped presentation choosers from their two shipped tokens to the registered
   set at the same time (Built-in's Options row and the table Original's Game Options page draws
   from), so a switch into and out of the new presentation works from both of them.
7. **Register it.** One `registry.Register(PresentationId.<Name>, () => new <Name>Presentation(...))`
   in `Launcher.BuildMenuHost`, reading `_menuAid` for the cold start's aid as the two shipped
   factories do.
8. **Answer availability.** If the presentation needs extracted files, add its check to the
   `Availability` delegate `Launcher` installs (`OriginalAvailable` is the shipped one; extend it or
   compose a second), deriving the required set from what the screens draw and reconciling it in
   the coverage test as `OriginalCoverageTests` does. If it needs nothing, registration alone is its
   availability.
9. **Add its aids.** `--menu=` values under `--presentation=<token>`, documented in `cli.md`'s
   bullet, no flag added. Keep every campaign pose on `CampaignAidProfiles`' scratch store.
10. **Add the driven suites.** One in-engine suite per journey family in `CSVM/src/Testing/`, over
    a real `MenuHost` through `MenuSuiteHost`, standing for the presentation what
    `menu-original-tracer`, `menu-original-instant-action`, `menu-original-hangar`,
    `menu-original-campaign` and the Original half of `menu-player-setup-seats` stand for Original;
    add the presentation's cases to `menu-launch-return`, which drives every exit and every
    destination at the host's sink. Register each suite in `SuiteCatalog`.
11. **Prove Built-in unchanged.** Shoot Built-in's aids before and after and compare decoded pixels;
    the only Built-in change a new presentation may make is to the Options chooser.
12. **Document it.** Its `##` entries in `architecture/UI.md` with their index lines in
    `architecture.md`, its remake-only readings where they belong, `cli.md`'s aids, and this
    page's registration paragraph.
13. **Run the landing gate.** The complete `.\RunTests.ps1`, then the at-the-controls pass: each
    mode to FLY and back through the pause board's Exit, a campaign mission to its end and back to
    the scrapbook, a real pad's join and walk, the sounds, the pointer, a cold start on an aid, a
    switch into and out of the presentation from both Options screens.

## The verification layers

Five layers, each catching what the others cannot:

- **Engine-free contracts.** The seam fixtures (`MenuSeamContractTests`, two fake presentations
  driving one fake feature to the same exit), the host (`MenuHostTests`), the store and the
  resolution rule, every feature's own tests, the shell tests over hand-authored layouts, the
  coverage check, the manifest cases, and the two metadata scans. `dotnet test` runs them all;
  those over the player's data are `[ExtractedDataFact]`s.
- **Hand-authored legal fixtures.** `CSVM.Tests/fixtures/menu-layout/` for the decoder and
  `fixtures/menu-layout-original/` for the shell: invented geometry and file names in the shipped
  file's shape, so no game data is committed and every rule is still exercised.
- **Local extracted-data comparisons.** Built-in's aids shot before and after a change and compared
  by decoded pixels; Original's aids shot at 800x600, 1280x720, 1920x1080 and 600x750 to show the
  fit; the manifest's recovery probes over a scratch copy of the data root, never the player's tree.
- **Driven suites.** The `menu-*` suites and `campaign-layout-parity` through real hosts and real
  shells over the install's own layout, up to the host's sink. The harness runs a suite before any
  session builds, so no suite flies a launch or performs the frame-deferred switch.
- **At the controls.** The launcher's leg and everything a suite cannot hear or hold: the flown
  launch and its return in every mode and both presentations, the real switch both ways, a real
  pad, the sounds, the pointer's rollover and pressed frames.

# Net

The network seam: what carries bytes between peers, the in-process carrier the suites run on, the
ENet carrier a match ships over, and the one place a build picks between them. Only the ENet
carrier and the port mapping name an engine type beyond Godot's plain math structs, and nothing
here names a socket API, which is what lets one session run over the loopback in a plain unit test
and over ENet in a match; the boundary and its exemptions are asserted over compiled metadata by
`CSVM.Tests/NetNamespaceDependencyTests.cs`, which also holds every Steam name to the Steam
carrier. Nothing about the world crosses this seam, and the message vocabulary sits entirely above
it.

One `## src/...` entry per module, body at most 8 lines.

Traps do not live here; the rule is in `docs/architecture.md`. What the original sends, with its
type ids, payloads and guarantees, is in [../org/multiplayer-messages.md](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## The rules a network session keeps

These are the design rules every module below is shaped by, and every multiplayer change keeps.

- **Owner-authoritative aircraft, host-authoritative match and world.** Each machine simulates and
  sends its own aeroplanes. The host owns everything shared: the match clock, the scores, spawns and
  the rotation, the AI, zeppelins, turrets, surface vehicles, destructibles and the campaign's
  mission director. It is the original's shape (a dying pilot's own client reports the death,
  [../org/multiplayer-scoring.md](../org/multiplayer-scoring.md)) and needs no cross-machine
  determinism, which Godot's physics and collision queries do not give; there is no lockstep and
  no server-side prediction.
- **Nothing about the world crosses the wire.** Every peer builds the same world from its own
  extraction and the handshake's master seed. Only pilot states, fire, hits and deaths, the
  host-owned world's spawns, states and damage, director transitions, the match clock and the
  roster are sent; a mesh, a node or an animation never is.
- **Modes.** Dogfight and campaign co-op. Co-op is the host's campaign with guests flying as its
  human field, the local splitscreen campaign's shape: a guest has no profile or progression of its
  own, its save is never touched, and it flies stock planes, since its own machine simulates the
  airframe it flies. A Dogfight pilot may fly a custom plane when the host's Allow Custom Planes and
  outlaw list admit it, and a co-op host's own custom planes fly; every machine builds a custom plane
  from its owner's `NetPlaneBuild`. Capture the flag and Zeppelin vs are not built.
- **Listen server.** One player hosts; there is no dedicated headless host.
- **The player ceiling is 16.** `NetSeats.MaxPlayers`, with every seat-indexed table built
  `SeatCapacity` wide. The original has no coded cap (its pilot list is never counted against a
  maximum, [../org/multiplayer-spawn.md](../org/multiplayer-spawn.md)) and its lobby reads
  `Players (1 of 16)`. The authored colour table and the 45-degree respawn fan serve eight, so seats
  8 to 15 take derived colours (`BL-1017`) and the fan wraps. Co-op caps at four humans (`n/4`),
  the campaign's P1 to P4 field.
- **The carrier is a flag.** ENet ships, by LAN search or direct IP with an IPv4 UPnP mapping or an
  IPv6 pinhole. A Steam carrier (Networking Sockets, relay, lobbies) is added behind `CsvmSteam`
  without touching a session; listing the game on Steam is a distribution and legal decision, not
  the code's.
- **Two seams above the transport.** On the session side `INetTransport`; on the aircraft side a
  `FlightController` fed a `RemotePoseBuffer` in place of an `IFlightInputSource`. A remote human is
  a pose that arrives late, never a stick that arrives late. Godot's `MultiplayerApi`,
  `MultiplayerSynchronizer` and `[Rpc]` are not used: they replicate node properties with no
  interpolation and would put a Godot type in every session.
- **Hit authority.** The shooter's machine decides a hit, the victim's owner applies the damage and
  reports its own death, and the host scores. There is no lag compensation; the original has none.
  A hit is its own reliable message, where the original batches hits onto its unreliable aircraft
  state, because a lost hit is a lost kill.
- **Star topology.** A guest connects to the host alone, and the host relays every guest's states
  and events to the other guests (`NetSession`), so one port and one router mapping serve a match
  and a guest-to-guest packet costs one extra hop. Guests never connect to each other.
- **The doors are the Original presentation's.** The campaign cabin's Host Co-op button opens the
  network and reads Close Network while open; the NETWORK OPEN band shows the address and guest
  count, and a chip per guest its Ready mark. Close Network, or leaving the cabin for the main menu,
  returns every guest to the Connection screen with "Host closed the game". The game is advertised
  as `<profile>'s campaign`, with no password. A guest joins from the Multiplayer Connection screen,
  by LAN search into the games list or by Internet IP address. The Connection screen's Host opens
  the Multiplayer Lobby, where Dogfight is the one live mode; co-op has no lobby. The Built-in
  menu, off by default, keeps its own network boards.
- **A pause halts nothing.** In a network session the pause sheet is an overlay (`PauseState`):
  the world, the AI, the director, the net ticks and the pauser's own aeroplane run on, the
  aeroplane flying trimmed on a centred stick with its commands swallowed until the sheet closes.
  Offline play, splitscreen included, still freezes the clock. Only the host's sheet offers
  Restart: a co-op restart relaunches the mission on every machine through the door's next round,
  and a Dogfight restart reruns the match in place for everyone.
- **Everyone starts together.** No machine's simulation runs until every machine flying a seat has
  built its world: the mission clock, the AI and the world events wait with the aeroplanes, behind
  the load screen (`NetStartGate`). A drop or a timeout releases the wait.

## src/Net/INetTransport.cs
The seam itself, and the two types it is spoken in. `NetReliability` is the three classes a
payload can be sent under, `INetTransportListener` is what a transport tells its owner (a peer
joined, a peer left, a payload landed), and `INetTransport` is the carrier: the peer roster,
`Send` of a byte span with its class and channel, `Bind` of the one listener, `Disconnect`, and
`Step`, which is the only place a payload is ever delivered. A session holds the interface and
constructs neither implementation itself. Read `LoopbackTransport.cs` for the carrier the suites
use.

## src/Net/LoopbackConditions.cs
One direction's wire conditions as a value: a latency, a symmetric jitter half-width about it, and
a loss probability, all in seconds and all validated at construction. `Delay` and `Drops` are the
two draws, taken from a caller-supplied `Random` rather than an ambient one, so a seeded suite
replays the same network exactly and a reliable stream costs no loss draw. Which classes loss may
touch is the transport's rule, not this value's.

## src/Net/LoopbackTransport.cs
Transports wired to each other in one process through delivery queues, one `LoopbackConditions`
per direction, changeable through `SetConditions` so a suite makes a reorder instead of waiting
for the jitter. `Mesh` builds and links the set; nothing arrives until `Step` advances that end's
own clock, which gives a test delivery time. The guarantees are enforced: loss is drawn only for
the unreliable classes, a reliable stream's deadlines stay monotonic per sender, and a sequenced
payload at or below the newest on its channel is discarded. `Lost` (per channel in `LostOn`) and
`DiscardedStale` are the truth `NetInstruments`' gap count is checked against, less the events
channel, which no sequence stream rides. Read `LoopbackTransportTests.cs`.

## src/Net/EnetTransport.cs
The shipped carrier over Godot's ENet peer, and the one type under `CSVM/` allowed to name a Godot
networking type. `Host` opens a listen server on every address `ListenAddresses` names (for `*`:
IPv4's wildcard, the stable global IPv6 address and `::1`) as one roster, so a reply leaves from the
address a guest dialled; a guest drops a reply from a temporary one. `Join` reports the host (peer 1)
joining. Every roster change and payload comes out of `Step`. A service thread polls ENet when the
main thread has not stepped for `ServiceGapSeconds`, up to `Keepalive.CeilingSeconds`, so a
blocking mission load keeps acknowledging. `INetLink` is where a board reads the socket, and a
socket with no listener holds what lands and replays it on `Bind`.

## src/Net/SteamTransport.cs
The Steam carrier's place in the seam with nothing behind it: the Steamworks SDK cannot be
committed here under its licence, so every way in throws "not built with the Steamworks SDK" and
says which of the two cases the build is. `SteamBuild` is the `CSVM_STEAM` define, set by the
`CsvmSteam` build property, and the only thing that define changes. The throw is an
`InvalidOperationException`, the kind the door and the launcher already catch from a socket that
will not open, so a Steam build reaches a board as a line of text rather than a crash. Read
`NetCarrier.cs` for where it is chosen.

## src/Net/NetCarrier.cs
Which carrier a match runs over, chosen once: the menu door's registration in `Launcher.cs` and
the command line's own open both come through `Host` and `Join`, so a build changes carrier with
no edit above the seam. `UsesSteam` is the switch, `Name` the log word. `PortMap`/`PortUnmap` are
the router door a direct-IP host asks for, `Pinhole` (given the address) and `PinholeClose` its
IPv6 pinhole, and `StableIpv6`/`LanIpv4` the addresses it names (`Utils/HostAddress.cs`). All are
null for a carrier reachable without them. The launcher opens the pinhole for the stable address.
⚠ Nothing above the seam branches on the carrier.

## src/Net/UpnpPortMap.cs
A best-effort port mapping through Godot's UPnP client, so a host behind a router is reachable
from outside it. `Map` returns one of five outcomes a board can show (mapped, no gateway, refused,
timed out, no public address) with the external address and lease, `Unmap` takes it back down, and
neither throws. No gateway means no device answered. Godot calls a gateway invalid when its
connection check fails without saying why, so for such a device this file asks the description's
connection services for the external address itself, over Godot's `HttpClient`, whose `Get` and
`Soap` exchanges `UpnpPinholeMap.cs` shares. Both calls block for the gateway search, so they
belong on the door's own thread. The rules are `UpnpLease.cs`'s; this is the only file naming `Upnp`.

## src/Net/IgdAddress.cs
A gateway's external address read without the engine. `Kind` sorts an IPv4 address into public,
private (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), shared (100.64/10, a provider's carrier-grade NAT) and
reserved; the documentation ranges read as public. `Connections`, `ExternalAddressRequest` and
`ExternalAddressOf` are the device description and SOAP text of a GetExternalIPAddress question,
which `UpnpPortMap.cs` sends; `IgdPinhole.cs` reads its descriptions through the same parse. A
malformed answer parses to nothing. Read `IgdAddressTests.cs`.

## src/Net/UpnpLease.cs
The router mapping's rules, engine-free behind `IUpnpGateway`. A gateway that answered, usable or
not, is asked its external address first; a private, shared or reserved one returns
`NoPublicAddress` with no delete and no add, since no mapping behind a carrier's NAT is reachable.
A mapping asks a finite lease of `LeaseSeconds` (TUNE, `BL-1043`), and one that draws error 725
gets a permanent one. A fresh add first deletes the stale mapping on the port and on the port the
last run remembered, by exact port only; a renewal only adds again. `NextRenewal` says when the door
asks next: half the lease after a grant, an eighth after a failed renewal, never for a permanent
lease; the IPv6 pinhole renews on the same schedule. Read `UpnpLeaseTests.cs`.

## src/Net/UpnpPortMemory.cs
The one port this machine last mapped, kept in `upnp_port.txt` under the user directory so a run
after a crash can delete the mapping it left. Apart from `options.json` because the mapping thread
writes it. A missing or unreadable file recalls no port, and a failed write costs only the stale
clear, so nothing here throws.

## src/Net/UpnpPinholeMap.cs
A best-effort IPv6 pinhole in the host's router, for a line whose IPv4 has no public address.
Godot's UPnP client maps IPv4 only, so `Open` finds the IGD v2 `WANIPv6FirewallControl:1` service
by an SSDP search (through `LanDiscoverySocket.cs`) and speaks SOAP to the control URL its
description names, over `UpnpPortMap.cs`'s HTTP exchange. `Open` renews the pinhole this process
holds, `Close` deletes it by UniqueID; neither throws and both block, so they run on the door's
thread. The FRITZ!Box 7590 names the service in both `igddesc.xml` and `igd2desc.xml`, at
`/igd2upnp/control/WANIPv6Firewall1`. The rules are `UpnpPinhole.cs`'s; the memory is
`UpnpPinholeMemory.cs`.

## src/Net/UpnpPinhole.cs
The IPv6 pinhole's rules, engine-free behind `IPinholeGateway`. Each missing piece stops before
any add with its own outcome: no global address (`NoAddress`, no gateway call), no service,
a firewall that is off, a `GetFirewallStatus` that allows no inbound pinhole (`Disallowed`). A
pinhole takes `UpnpLease.LeaseSeconds`, is renewed by UniqueID (`UpdatePinhole`) and re-added when
the router forgot it; the door renews on `UpnpLease.NextRenewal`'s schedule. A fresh add first
deletes the pinhole an earlier run remembered, only while its lease runs, since the router frees
the number after. Read `UpnpPinholeTests.cs`.

## src/Net/IgdPinhole.cs
The IPv6 firewall service's text without the engine: the SSDP M-SEARCH and the LOCATION of an
answer for that search target, the service's control URL in a device description, the
GetFirewallStatus, AddPinhole (wildcard remote host and port, protocol 17), UpdatePinhole and
DeletePinhole envelopes, and their answers and UPnP faults (606 and 703 read as a refusal).
`IsGlobalUnicast` is the plain-text 2000::/3 check a pinhole address must pass. A malformed answer
parses to nothing. Read `UpnpPinholeTests.cs`.

## src/Net/UpnpPinholeMemory.cs
The IPv6 pinhole this machine last opened, kept in `upnp_pinhole.txt` under the user directory as
its UniqueID, port, address and lease end, so a run after a crash can delete it while its lease
still runs. A missing or unreadable file recalls none, and a failed write costs only that clear.

## src/Net/NetLobby.cs
A carrier's first listener and itself the `INetTransport` the session later binds, since a carrier
binds only once. A host's `Advertise` sends a `SessionAdvertMessage` to every peer on connect and on
each change; a guest keeps the latest in `Advert` and the host's closing word in `Closed`. Co-op
board messages stay here too: a host keeps each guest's latest `CoopPick` and `PickBuilds`, a guest
the latest flow, `SeatFits`, `SeatBuilds`, `PlaneRules`, `Wingman` and `Film`. Others are held (up to `HeldPayloads`) until a session binds, then replayed
behind the peer announcement. ⚠ A new round seen while bound marks `FlightOver` until the next bind,
so the opener survives both unbinds a restart makes. A peer whose build version does not play goes
on `Clashing` and off every peer list. Read `NetLobbyTests.cs`.

## src/Net/NetBuildVersion.cs
MAJOR.MINOR of the build's SemVer string, which two peers compare before they play: builds a patch
apart play, and `Unknown`, a string that does not parse, plays only with another unknown. The
caller hands in the string, so a unit parses without an engine. `BuildVersionMessage` (`0x56`) is
the lobby's first word on connect. ⚠ Its layout is frozen, since an older build must still read a
newer one's version to name the mismatch. Wire: [../org/multiplayer-messages.md](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## src/Net/LanDiscovery.cs
The LAN search's datagram pair, apart from the carrier: `LanDiscovery` writes and reads a query
and a reply of one fixed width on `Port`, `LanGame` is one answer (the reply's source address, the
game port it names, the host's advert and its build version), and `ILanSocket` is the datagram seam the responder and
the search are handed. ⚠ The query is padded to the reply's width, so a responder never sends more
than it was sent and cannot amplify a forged-source flood. Layout:
[../org/multiplayer-messages.md](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## src/Net/LanResponder.cs
An open door's answer to a search, over a socket bound on `LanDiscovery.Port` only while the door
hosts. `Poll` answers each well-formed query with the door's advert and game port, to the address
the query came from, and reads at most `QueriesPerPoll` a frame so a flood costs bounded work.
Anything that is not a whole query of this version is read and dropped unanswered.

## src/Net/LanSearch.cs
A guest's search for open doors. `Ask` starts a round with a fresh token, sent to every address
its seam yields that round (`LanBroadcast.Targets` in a shipped door, one address in a suite).
`Poll` keeps the replies carrying that token, and `Games` lists what answered the current or the
last round in first-answer order, so a host that closed leaves on the next round. Replies to an
older round and foreign datagrams are dropped. Read `LanDiscoveryTests.cs`.

## src/Net/LanBroadcast.cs
Where a search asks each round: `Limited` (255.255.255.255) first, then the directed broadcast
(address with every host bit set) of each IPv4 network the machine sits on, once each, loopback and
single-host masks skipped. ⚠ The limited broadcast alone is not enough: Windows sends it out of one
adapter only, so a machine with several adapters can miss its host's network. The networks come
from `Utils/LocalNetworks.cs` through `NetPlayFeature.LanNetworks`.

## src/Net/LoopbackLan.cs
The in-process datagram network the suites and the screenshot aids run the LAN search on, the
discovery counterpart of `LoopbackTransport`. A send to `Broadcast` reaches every socket on its
port and any other send reaches one socket; delivery is immediate and lossless. It opens no real
socket, so no run of it raises a firewall dialog.

## src/Net/LanDiscoverySocket.cs
The shipped `ILanSocket` over Godot's UDP peer with broadcast sends allowed, polled from the menu
frame. ⚠ Besides `EnetTransport`, the only type under `CSVM/` that may name a Godot networking
type, asserted by `NetNamespaceDependencyTests.cs`. A suite binds it on the loopback address,
since a wildcard bind is what raises a firewall dialog.

## src/Net/NetMessages.cs
The vocabulary: `NetMessageType` (one word per message), the death, spawn and match-end enums
taken from the original's own values, `NetDirectorEvent` (the director message's codes and id
layouts), `NetWorldEvent` (the world event's codes), `NetPositionalStart` (the positional start's kinds), `NetSessionKind`, and the message structs, the host's spawn grant, a seat's ask, the host's death notice, the clock ping and the lobby's `SessionAdvertMessage` among them. Each is a value type implementing `INetMessage<TSelf>`,
which carries its type word and its `INetTransport.cs` reliability class as static abstracts, so
a sender reads the class off the type without constructing anything. `NetMessage` holds what they
share: the four-byte header, the no-seat and no-spawn-entry markers, the aircraft-state width
budget, `ReliabilityOf`, `IsOriginalId`, and `TryReadHeader`, the one call a receiver makes
before it knows which deserialiser to run. Read `NetMessageWriter.cs` next.

## src/Net/NetWorldMessages.cs
The host-owned world's messages, beside the vocabulary rather than in it: `AiStateMessage`
(an AI's pose by admission ordinal, plain unreliable because every AI shares one channel, with
`AsAircraftState` for the pose buffer), `AiFireMessage`, `AiHitMessage` and `DestructibleHitMessage`
(a guest's claim on an AI or a pool, to the host alone), `ZeppelinStateMessage` (one zeppelin of the
original's `0x1e`, by placement index), `AiSpawnMessage` (a host generator launch at its ordinal),
`SurfaceVehicleStateMessage` (a hull's patrol), `CutsceneSkipMessage` (one episode's skip, by name
key and ordinal) and `WorldEventMessage`, whose `NetWorldEvent` code says what its fields carry.
Ids and phase mapping: [../org/multiplayer-messages.md](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## src/Net/NetCoopMessages.cs
The campaign co-op boards' five messages, all reliable and all kept in `NetLobby` rather than a
session. `CoopFlowMessage` is the host's boards as one guest follows them: the screen, the mission,
the round of picks (`Epoch`), the guest's player number, the Ready mask, the hangar's airframes and,
on the debrief, the host's result. `CoopPickMessage` is a guest's airframe, `CoopFit`, name, Ready
and Left under the round it answers, so an earlier round's Ready never launches the next mission.
Before the session opener `CoopSeatFitMessage` tells every guest one seat's fit, and
`CoopWingmanMessage` the host's wingman airframe and fit, so a guest never builds its own default.
`CoopFilmMessage` names a film the host started or ended. [Layout](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## src/Net/NetDogfightMessages.cs
The Multiplayer Lobby's three messages, all reliable and all kept in `NetLobby` rather than a
session. `DogfightOptionsMessage` is the host's Mission Options under the round they belong to,
`DogfightRosterMessage` is the whole player list with the reading guest's own row marked, and
`LobbyChatMessage` is one typed line under its speaker's name, which the host relays. A guest's
plane and Ready ride `CoopPickMessage`. Layout:
[../org/multiplayer-messages.md](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## src/Net/NetPlaneMessages.cs
Custom planes on the wire. `NetPlaneBuild` is one plane's airframe, engine, armour, hardpoints, guns
and paint as the saved record holds them, and `PlaneBuildMessage` carries one: a guest's pick, or a
seat's build at launch. `NetPlaneRules` is the host's Allow Custom Planes, Outlaw Components and the
original's 34-flag outlaw list; `Refuses` and `Enforce` are the original's Ready check, so every end
judges a plane alike. `LobbyPlaneRulesMessage` sends the rules. Decode:
[../org/multiplayer-messages.md](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## src/Net/NetPositionalMessages.cs
`PositionalStartMessage`, the one message a position-started definition crosses as: a landing row
the host's trigger started and the seat that flew it, the ladder switch's holder, and a guest's
held auto-land button, told apart by `NetPositionalStart`. Reliable, since each is a decision sent
once. Kinds and the replay mapping: [../org/multiplayer-messages.md](../org/multiplayer-messages.md).

## src/Net/NetMessageWriter.cs
The two cursors every serialiser and deserialiser runs on, `NetMessageWriter` and
`NetMessageReader`, kept in one file because they are one pair and drift apart if they are not.
Little-endian primitives over the caller's span, plus the two quantised forms the layouts need: a
unit-range field as a 16-bit integer, and a fixed-width UTF-8 field that truncates on a whole
character. The writer opens with the header and patches the total length in on `Close`; the
reader reads the header in its constructor, so `Type`, `Length` and `Valid` answer before any
payload byte is touched. A text field decodes on the stack, so a read allocates only its string.
`NetMessageFuzzTests.cs` feeds every reader random, truncated and mislabelled bytes.

## src/Net/NetClockSlew.cs
How a guest holds its session clock against the host's, as one offset that is walked rather than
written: `HostTime(guest) = guest + Offset`, and a fresh `Observe` sets a target the offset
converges on over `ConvergeSeconds`, bounded by `MaxRateOffset` of real time, never overshooting.
A reading further out than `SnapSeconds` is applied at once and counted in `Snaps`, which is the
signal that the window is wrong rather than the link. `ObserveRoundTrip` keeps the newest
`RoundTrip`, and every one-way reading is read forward by half of it; the first round trip is
applied at once, as the end of the opening alignment. Engine-free and clock-free, so a unit
suite drives it whole. The three constants are TUNE (`BL-1018`).

## src/Net/NetClockPing.cs
The round trip a guest's `NetClockSlew` takes the link latency from, modelled on the original's
`0x23` ping. `Follow` makes a guest ask the host's clock from its first `Step`, again every
`IntervalSteps` (the original's ten seconds) after an answer and every `RetrySteps` (TUNE,
`BL-1018`) without one;
`Answer` makes the host reply at once with its clock. An answer overtaken by a newer one, or
stamped later than the guest's clock reads, is dropped. `Asked` and `Answered` are the counters a
suite reads, the host's `Answered` being the arrivals its relay leaves alone.

## src/Net/NetStartGate.cs
The start barrier of a network flight, and its `0x5B` word. A host's gate waits on every linked
machine flying a seat; each guest sends `Loaded` at the end of its build, and the host opens when
the last one arrives, when the last one still loading drops, or after `TimeoutSeconds` (TUNE, under
the ENet keepalive ceiling). It then broadcasts `Start`, and answers a `Loaded` that arrives later
with a `Start` of its own. A guest's gate opens on that word or on its host's link dropping. Pure
state: `GameSession` holds `GameClock.StartHeld` while the gate is closed and steps only the wire.

## src/Net/NetHandshake.cs
What a host hands a joining guest before either flies: the master seed and the host's session
clock at send. The seed reaches `GameSession`'s constructor through `LauncherContext`, where it
replaces the launch's own master before `Rng.Reset` runs, which is what makes both peers draw the
same liveries, the same spawn walk and the same dice. The clock becomes the opening offset of the
guest's `NetClockSlew`. The record is what a session hands to and takes from the wire; the bytes
that carry it are the message vocabulary's.

## src/Net/NetSeat.cs
One pilot's place in a match, shaped like the record the original allocates per player: the peer it
is addressed by, its team, whether this machine flies it, its callsign, its airframe and paint, its
seat index and its signed score. `Color` reads the seat's own entry in `NetSeats`. The seat index is
the whole identity: a remote pilot indexes spawns, scores, markers and colours exactly as a
splitscreen pane does, which is why the session orders its rigs by it. Read
`docs/architecture/Session.md`'s `GameSession.cs` entry for where a seat becomes an aeroplane
without a pane.

## src/Net/NetSeats.cs
The roster's rules: `MaxPlayers = 16` pilots admitted, the count the original's lobby shows and
its data holds, every seat-indexed table built `SeatCapacity = 16` wide, each seat's identity
colour, and `Validate`, which requires seats numbered from zero with no gap and at least one flown here. `Field` builds a host's roster from its local planes and the peers on its wire; `CoopField` does so for co-op, naming each guest by its own player name.
Seats 0 to 7 take the original's authored dwords at `00628eb4` in order (the remake's index is
0-based where the original's was 1-based and its eighth pilot read past the table); seats 8 to 15
take the channel-wise complement of seat minus 8. The channel order and the derived eight are TUNE
(`BL-1017`).

## src/Net/RemotePoseBuffer.cs
One remote aircraft's received history and the pose to draw it at now. A sample sits on the
sender's timeline by its sequence, never its arrival; a playout clock walks it `BufferDelaySeconds`
behind the newest arrival at the fitted sender clock rate plus a damped lead correction, and
re-anchors only past `SnapSeconds`. `Clear` (a respawn) drops the samples but keeps the timeline,
since the sender's sequence runs on. Past the newest sample it rides velocity for at most
`ExtrapolationCapSeconds`, then holds; `RemotePoseFeed` names the case. Stale sequences drop, wrap
included. `Tally` counts reads by feed, stale drops, and each sample's miss against its
predecessor's velocity (past twice its reach, a jump). `RemotePosePlaybackTests` measures playback.

## src/Net/AircraftStateCadence.cs
The send half of aircraft replication, and the only thing in it that is not the session's own
step: when an owner puts its aeroplane on the wire, counted in simulation steps, and what
sequence each sample carries, counted per seat because a receiver decides staleness by it. What a
sample holds is the session's to fill and what happens to it is `RemotePoseBuffer.cs`'s, so this
module knows neither. `SendStepInterval` is accepted as measured; at the fixed step it puts two send
intervals inside the buffer's own read-behind, which is what lets one lost sample still leave a
pair to read between. `SampleSeconds` is that interval in seconds, what a sequence gap is worth.

## src/Net/MatchStateCadence.cs
When a host repeats the match state, counted in simulation steps. It exists only for the clock:
every change that matters (the limits at the build, the rematch, the ending) is sent where it
happens, and the tick is what refreshes the remaining time and gives `NetClockSlew` the one
reading a running match repeats. `TickStepInterval` is 60, a second at the fixed step, which is
the rate the versus HUD's whole-second readout can show a difference at. TUNE (`BL-1025`). The
first step ticks, so a guest holds the host's limits inside one step of its build. What the
message carries is `GameSession`'s to fill. Read `docs/architecture/Session.md`'s entry for it.

## src/Net/NetChannels.cs
Which channel a message rides. Sequenced discard is per sender and channel, and a relayed sample
carries the host's peer id rather than its sender's, so two guests sharing one channel would
discard each other by sequence number: `ForSeat` gives every seat its own, and `Events` carries
the join and everything reliable, where nothing is discarded. `ForFire` gives each seat's fire a
channel above the whole state range, since a burst judged against the pose samples around it
would be discarded as overtaken. `Count` is the layout's width. A seat past the roster's ceiling
falls back to `Events`, which costs ordering rather than delivery.

## src/Net/NetSession.cs
The one object a session owns to talk to its peers: it holds the transport, implements the
listener, sends a typed message under the class the type declares, and routes an arrival to the
handler registered on its type word. The only meaning it knows is the join, a host answering each
peer with the handshake (which names the seat) and then the roster; `On` refuses those two types,
and a guest refuses a join `NetSeats.Validate` would throw on. The star's relay: `SendToSeat`
addresses a seat through whoever owns it, and a host's `RelayToOthers` and `RelayToSeatOwner`
forward an arrival's own bytes, never back to its sender. A suite reads the counters (`Sent`,
`Received`, `Relayed`, `DroppedUnknown`, `Malformed`) and `Instruments`, fed before any handler.

## src/Net/NetInstruments.cs
One machine's desync counters over its own traffic, engine-free, read by `net-soak` and the
`--debug-net` readout. Rules: a seat's first state or fire sample sets its ladder, and each later
gap counts as dropped; an arrival at or below the newest is stale, except a burst filling a fire
gap inside the last 64, which rides unsequenced and is counted reordered; a hit or a burst for a seat
reported dead and not placed again is late; a score line adding deaths nobody reported, or a
respawn for a known seat nobody reported dead, is out of order. A seat's first score line and a
line whose deaths fall (a rematch) only set the baseline. Position error needs the owner's path
and is the soak's to measure. `Describe` writes the one readout line.

# Testing

The in-engine assertion harness: `--run-tests` and the `--dump-*` probes, plus the `CSVM.Tests/` xUnit project's engine-free reader units and golden invariants.

One `## src/...` entry per module, body at most 8 lines, 12 for the highest-traffic modules.

Traps do not live here; the rule is in `docs/architecture.md`.

## CSVM.Tests/
The xUnit project `dotnet test` runs (net8.0, `ProjectReference` to `CSVM.csproj`): the
engine-free reader units (`Zrdr`, `WavFile`, `SoundDefs`, `WeaponDefs`, `Messages`,
`SessionPaths`, `GameZ` transform arithmetic, `MarkerRig`, `AnimDefs` and the rest) plus the
golden invariants over a player's own `extracted/`. `TestData.cs` owns both input sources, the
hand-authored `fixtures/` tree and the `CSVM_DATA_ROOT` lookup behind `[ExtractedDataFact]`, and
states the rule binding each. A check that needs a live Godot belongs in `CSVM/src/Testing`
instead; read `TestHarness.cs` for that half.

## src/Testing/Probes.cs
The assertion cores behind the `--dump-markers` / `--dump-weapons` / `--dump-loadout` /
`--dump-flight` / `--dump-mips` / `--dump-debris` / `--damage-test` / `--effects-test` reports. Each
probe does the work once and returns both halves: the report text a flag prints and writes, and the
structured verdict a `--run-tests` suite asserts on, so a dump and the suite reading it cannot
disagree. The envelope, effects, damage and debris-shading sweeps each carry their thresholds, row
order and sources at their own members. The reachability half of a flight row is
`EnvelopeMargins.cs`, the suites asserting on these verdicts are the `*Suites.cs` modules, and the
branch vocabulary is [../org/flightModel.md](../org/flightModel.md).

## src/Testing/EnvelopeMargins.cs
The reachability half of the flight-envelope report. `Sample` reads one completed `FlightModel`
step's public state and keeps, per scenario, the distance to each term that could have bounded it
(the G clamp, the C_L ceiling, the AOA window, the stall speed, the altitude band, the dive cap);
`Take` formats that as the row's `margins:` line, and across an airframe it also records which of
`Branches` the scenarios reached. Nothing here feeds a force. Read `Probes.cs` for the report it
lands in; the branch names and which instrument drives each unreached one are in
[../org/flightModel.md](../org/flightModel.md), "Parity ledger".

## src/Testing/TestHarness.cs
`--run-tests[=filter]`: the suite registry, `TestContext` (assert verbs, resolved data paths, a
scene-tree host, `SyncPhysics` for the space a one-frame run leaves behind, and the `WithWorld`
chapter-world builder over `WorldSession`), the PASS/FAIL/SKIP table, `test-report.json` in
`TestContext.ScratchDir`, and the process exit code. `Select` is the pure selector over the flag's
value; `SuiteShards` handles the one term that divides rather than selects. The world cache and its
eviction, the mission-override and private-world forms, the shared `DecodeCache`, the per-build
`StartupProfile` and the engine-error allowlist each carry their own rule at their member. Read
`SuiteCatalog.cs` for registration and `PhaseAttribution.cs` for a build's time in the report.

## src/Testing/SuiteShards.cs
Godot-free and pure (`CSVM.Tests` proves it without the engine): the `shard:<index>/<count>` term
and the division behind it. `Parse` lifts that term out of a `--run-tests=` value and hands the rest
back as the selector; `Plan` divides an already-selected list longest-unit-first onto the lightest
shard and returns each shard in the input's order, so one tree always divides the same way.
`SuiteWeights` reads the measured per-suite seconds in `analysis/engine-suite-weights.json`, with a
default for a suite the file does not name and `Groups` for the sets a shard may not split. Read
`TestHarness.cs` for where a plan is applied.

## src/Testing/PhaseAttribution.cs
Godot-free and pure (`CSVM.Tests` proves it without the engine): buckets a `StartupProfile`'s raw
phase names into archive/decode, sound preparation and runtime/world construction, and does the
suite-level arithmetic (`Rest`, `Overrun`) behind the console phase suffix and `test-report.json`'s
per-suite and run totals. Which phase name lands in which bucket, and what happens to one that
lands in none, are stated at the sets themselves. Read `TestHarness.cs` for where a live profile is
fed in.

## src/Testing/CountingEmitterFactory.cs
`IEmitterFactory` for a suite: `Create` always succeeds and hands back a `CountingEmitter` that
holds no Godot type in its own state, just started/stopped counts, whether it is sustaining now and
the last position it was fed. Reached by installing it on `TestContext.EmitterFactory` before a
`WithWorld` build; `Built` is the list a suite reads to confirm the fake was reached rather than a
real `Puffer`. Read `RecordingEmitterRenderer.cs` for the seam one level lower.

## src/Testing/RecordingEmitterRenderer.cs
`IEmitterRenderer` for a suite: it keeps the particles a `Puffer` hands it (`LastFrame`, `Shown`,
`MaxShown`, `MaxIndex`, `MaxFrame`, plus the `Capacity` the emitter sized) instead of drawing them,
so a suite asserts on burst, distance-trail and sustain with no atlas, `TextureArchive` or
`MultiMesh` in the path. The mirror of `CountingEmitterFactory` one seam lower: that fake replaces
the whole emitter so `EmitterDirector`'s lifetime is assertable, this one replaces the draw so the
emitter's own modes are. Neither covers the other's job.

## src/Testing/SuiteCatalog.cs
The registry of the in-engine assertion suites, discovered from the `[Suite("name", "what")]`
attribute each body carries in the `*Suites.cs` modules; the catalog keeps no per-suite table, so
adding a suite means adding one marked body in one of those modules and nothing else. `QuickTier`
is the checked-in membership of `--run-tests=tier:quick`, resolved through `Tier(name)`. The
determinism rule behind the alphabetical registry order, and why a malformed declaration throws
rather than being skipped, are stated at the members themselves. Read `SuiteShards.cs` for what
depends on that order.

## src/Testing/*Suites.cs
The in-engine scenario bodies, one module per domain: the emitter model, combat and ordnance,
Instant Action, AI, targeting, wingmen, the campaign and its menus, music, zeppelins, damage and
destroy choreography, animation and effects, the built world's data gates and censuses, and the
landing, capture and coop surfaces. Each module holds one or more `[Suite("name", "what")]` bodies,
a `static void` taking a `TestContext`; `SuiteCatalog` discovers them by that attribute, so adding
a suite means adding a marked body to the module that already covers its domain, or a new module
when none does, and registering nothing anywhere else. The membership itself is the catalog's
output: `--run-tests` prints the table and writes `test-report.json`. They reach the harness only
through `TestContext`, and shared fixtures are separate focused modules (`SuiteConstants.cs`,
`BurstTimeline.cs`, `SuiteViewers.cs`, `EffectStageSuiteHelper.cs`, `MenuSuiteHost.cs`) rather than
an all-purpose helper. Per-suite traps live as comments on the suites themselves, in code.

## src/Testing/SuiteConstants.cs
The shared golden inputs used by more than one scenario module: airframe and weapon counts, puffer
timing, the destructible census, texture samples, and the ordnance-burst step and slack.

## src/Testing/BurstTimeline.cs
The three value types describing an authored ordnance-burst timeline and its observed dispatches.

## src/Testing/SuiteViewers.cs
Builds a test pane camera at a supplied world position for suites that exercise `ViewerSet`.

## src/Testing/EffectStageSuiteHelper.cs
Builds and frees a production-shaped, pooled effect-template stage for mesh-visibility suites.

## src/Testing/MenuSuiteHost.cs
The launchscreen fixture a menu suite stands a `LaunchMenu` on. `Bare` builds a `MenuHost` over an
empty `PresentationRegistry`, a silent `IMenuAudio` and a caller-owned exit list; `AddFeatures`
registers the same Free Flight, Instant Action, player-setup, hangar, campaign and controls
features the launcher wires; `Menu` returns a built launchscreen for a suite that reads nothing
back from the host. Seat 0 joins through the setup feature, which is why the seat is added after
the features, and the controls feature is registered in the form that saves nothing. Read
`UI/Menu/MenuHost.cs` for the host itself.

## src/Testing/GoldenShot.cs
The engine half of the golden-image tripwire: `PixelHash(Image)` (md5, lower-case hex) and
`Adapter()` (`"<gpu> / <api>"`). Called at the `--screenshot` save site, which prints
`[core] shot pixmd5=… size=… gpu=…` on every capture; `RunTests.ps1`'s `goldens` stage parses that
line and compares against `analysis/goldens/manifest.json`.

## src/Testing/ProbeRunner.cs
The `--dump-markers`/`--dump-weapons`/`--dump-flight`/`--dump-loadout`/`--dump-mips`/`--run-tests`/
`--effects-test`/`--damage-test`/`--destroy=` probe wrappers, constructed once in `Launcher._Ready`
after the base paths settle: the Launcher dispatches the early quits itself and hands the runner to
each session node. Each method reads a `SessionSpec` passed per call rather than storing one. It
also holds the two scripted world forces belonging to no session, `TriggerDestroy` (`--destroy=`)
and `ForceObjective` (`--debug-objective=`), the latter driving the nodes an objective's own
`INACTIVEn` conditions name so the graph completes it off its own conditions. Read `Probes.cs` for
the work each wrapper calls into.

## src/Testing/CaptureDirector.cs
The `--screenshot=`/`--shots=`/`--frames=` capture state machine plus F11/F12's placement print and
ad-hoc save, built in `Launcher._Ready` from the launch spec and `Tick()`ed from the Launcher's
`_Process`, so `--menu --screenshot` captures the launchscreen with no session node alive; it takes
its camera/orbit/rigs/clock as parameters. That capture reads synchronously, since the process
exits on its file. `SaveScreenshot`, the F12 save every screen shares, asks `PaneReadback` for the
frame and writes the PNG into `ShotDir()` (`Screenshots/`, git-ignored) on the worker it lands on,
logging "screenshot saved" there; it returns the path the file will take, not yet written. Read
`GoldenShot.cs` for what the save site prints.

## src/Testing/GltfExporter.cs
Exports any `Node3D` subtree to glTF: mesh, live material state, no animation and no emitters.
`Export(node, path)` works on a throwaway `node.Duplicate()`, frees hidden `Node3D`s (the panel/flare `Visible` toggles
are how damage is baked) and the point-sprite `"lights"` instances, and converts every shader skin to a
`StandardMaterial3D` over geometry with its winding reversed (`docs/formats/gotchas.md`: unreversed,
this data exports inside out). Format is extension-driven (`.glb` default). `ExportSet` writes several
subtrees under one root at their world transforms, dropping any an ancestor in the list carries.
`ExportToExports`/`ExportSetToExports` name a timestamped `Exports/` GLB. The viewer's `--export-gltf=`
one-shot and F10, and NodeLab's selection and export set actions, share that writer.

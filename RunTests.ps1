.SYNOPSIS
    The one verification entry point: build -> unit tests -> in-engine suites -> goldens,
    with a single summary block and a single exit code.

.DESCRIPTION
    Stages, run in order, each reported PASS / FAIL / SKIP / TODO:

      build    dotnet build CSVM/CSVM.sln. A failure stops the run: nothing downstream can
               say anything useful about a tree that does not compile.
      units    dotnet test CSVM/CSVM.sln -- the xUnit project. Built already by the build
               stage, so it runs --no-build; counts are read from a TRX log rather than
               scraped out of console text. A FAILED units stage does NOT stop the run (only
               a failed build does, above): engine, goldens and hitch all still launch, each
               scored from its own report so a red units row can never read as green in the
               summary block (BL-417).
      engine   Godot with --run-tests, the in-engine assertion suites. Windowed (never
               --headless: no shaders compile there, so a clean error screen would prove
               nothing) and with --log-file, which is what lets the harness screen native
               engine ERROR lines. --run-tests implies --det by itself. The full catalog runs
               in several concurrent processes (-Shards), each with its own log, report and
               scratch subdirectory; the stage's verdict is the merge of their reports.
      goldens  The golden-image tripwire: one Godot per shot in analysis/goldens/manifest.json,
               each a pinned --det capture, compared as md5 of the RAW pixel buffer (the engine
               prints it; a PNG's encoded bytes are not the picture). Runs as its own scripted
               pass rather than as an in-engine suite because the --run-tests harness completes
               inside one _Ready call and never yields a frame, so it cannot photograph anything.
               Up to -GoldenWorkers shots launch at once (default 4, measured bit-identical against
               serial), each still with its own process, log, .out/.err and PNG; the silent-death
               retry runs after the whole batch, serially. A mismatch names the shot and leaves the
               actual PNG and that shot's engine log in .scratch/goldens/. Each shot is launched
               under a per-shot timeout ($EngineTimeoutSec); a shot that exceeds it is killed,
               reported as FAIL, and has its evidence preserved -- it never silently hangs the
               suite (BL-320).
      perf     -Perf only. Every scenario in analysis/perf/scenarios.json, run under
               --det --perf --no-vsync for a fixed number of SIM frames (never wall seconds --
               the fixed clock advances one sim step per rendered frame, so a frame count is an
               exact amount of simulation). Each scenario is launched several times and the first
               launches are thrown away: a cold file cache reshapes a startup profile rather than
               scaling it. Medians of the kept windows land as one JSON line per scenario in the
               git-ignored perf-history.jsonl at the repo root. The stage records; it does not
               judge. A verdict needs -PerfCompare, which pairs this run against an earlier
               labelled one and prints the ratios.
      hitch    -Hitch only. Two scripted Godot launches -- a clean one and one carrying
               --hitch-inject=50@300 -- that report whether the frame-hitch detector
               (HitchMonitor/HitchSidecar) still fires on a known stall and stays silent without
               one. Awareness-only for the same reason goldens is one: the detector only trips on
               a REAL rendered frame over wall time, which --run-tests's single, frame-free _Ready
               call cannot produce. Reads the printed "[perf] hitch ..." line and the
               .hitches.jsonl sidecar it names, and checks the record's C8 attribution closes over
               its own frame cost. Off by default, even in a full run: it is not part of the
               retained landing gate (build, units, engine, goldens), since it never changes the
               exit code and its own subject changes rarely. Run it with -Hitch when landing a
               change that touches HitchMonitor.cs, HitchSidecar.cs, or the hitch tick in
               Launcher.cs, or periodically otherwise; a run without -Hitch prints it unchecked
               with that same cadence. Always the LAST stage, after perf, so its wall-time
               evidence is never taken beside engine, golden, or perf load.

    Exit code: 1 if any stage FAILED, 0 otherwise. A stage that skipped -- no game data, no
    Godot, -SkipUnits / -SkipEngine -- is NOT a failure, but it is printed as a skip and the
    summary names what went unchecked: "the data was not there" must never read as "the
    check held".

    Wall-time budgets: each stage row and the total print the measured budget for the lane the run
    is in (the complete gate, or -Quick), from analysis\verification-budgets.json -- which is where
    the numbers and the rule that set them live, so this help names the file rather than figures
    that would drift out of it. A stage over its budget prints "over budget" and is listed after
    the summary. These are AWARENESS thresholds and NEVER change the exit code: this is a
    workstation, and load the script cannot see must not turn a correct tree red. A skipped stage
    is compared against nothing, and the total is compared only when the lane's own stages all ran.

    Extracted game data is found through CSVM_DATA_ROOT by the engine and the unit tests
    alike, so this runs from a git worktree -- which has no extracted/, no tools/ and no
    CrimsonSkiesGame/ -- with that one variable pointed at the primary tree. Godot is
    resolved the same way RunGame.ps1 resolves it: this tree first, then CSVM_DATA_ROOT.

.PARAMETER Filter
    Substring filter on the in-engine suite names (-Filter weapons runs weapons-defs and
    weapons-fire). Engine stage only; the unit tests are unaffected -- use -UnitFilter.

.PARAMETER Suite
    Exact in-engine suite name(s), comma separated: -Suite weapons-fire runs that one suite and
    nothing else, where -Filter weapons-fire would still run anything else carrying the substring.
    A name no suite carries selects nothing and FAILS the stage; it is never an empty pass.
    Composable with -Filter, whose substring terms are unioned with these exact ones.

.PARAMETER UnitFilter
    Passed to dotnet test --filter, so the whole VSTest grammar is available: a
    FullyQualifiedName~Name for one test or class, or Tier=Quick for the checked-in quick unit
    tier. A filter matching no test FAILS the units stage rather than reporting a green zero.

.PARAMETER Shards
    How many Godot processes the engine stage divides the catalog over. 0 (the default) means the
    measured default for a full run and 1 for an explicit -Suite/-Filter/-Quick selection, which is
    faster started once than started N times. 1 is the serial reference path and stays selectable.
    Membership comes from analysis/engine-suite-weights.json through the harness's own
    shard:<index>/<count> term, so it is deterministic: the same tree divides the same way every
    run. Each shard gets its own engine log, report, scratch subdirectory and watchdog; the stage's
    verdict is the merge of every shard's report, and a shard exiting 0 without one FAILS the stage.

.PARAMETER Quick
    The broad partial confidence gate: build, the quick unit tier (Tier=Quick), the quick engine
    tier (--run-tests=tier:quick), and nothing else. Goldens and hitch are skipped and every
    omitted surface is named in the summary's "not checked:" lines. Membership of both tiers is
    checked in -- SuiteCatalog.QuickTier and the [Trait("Tier", "Quick")] classes -- and chosen by
    what each representative can catch, never inferred from a diff. An explicit -Suite/-Filter is
    added to the engine tier (quick plus the suite under edit); an explicit -UnitFilter replaces the
    unit tier, since the VSTest grammar can express the union itself. It is partial by construction
    and never satisfies the landing gate, which is the complete run.

.PARAMETER SkipUnits
    Skip the dotnet test stage.

.PARAMETER SkipEngine
    Skip the Godot --run-tests stage.

.PARAMETER SkipGoldens
    Skip the golden-image stage (it is the slow one -- one Godot launch per shot).

.PARAMETER RegenGoldens
    Re-render every shot and rewrite analysis/goldens/manifest.json with the hashes measured.
    Deliberately a separate switch and never automatic: the rewritten file is the review artifact,
    so a moved hash has to be explained in the commit that moves it.

.PARAMETER GoldenWorkers
    How many golden shots launch at once. Default 4: an A/B of 1/2/3/4 workers, three repeats each,
    found the complete 16-shot manifest bit-identical (raw-pixel hash, sim_frame, size, adapter) at
    every count with no GPU/driver contention observed on the machine measured, and 4 was the
    fastest of them (~29s against ~87s serial). Shots run in registry-order batches of this size;
    a shot's own process, log, .out/.err and PNG stay exactly as unique as the serial path, and the
    silent-death --verbose retry still happens, serially, after the whole batch has reported. Pass
    1 for the serial reference path. This was measured on one machine only, so a hash that moves
    under N>1 elsewhere is a disproof for THAT machine, not a tuning problem to chase
    (docs/PLAN-fast-verification.md C21).

.PARAMETER Hitch
    Run the hitch-detector check (two scripted Godot launches probing HitchMonitor/HitchSidecar).
    Off by default, even in a full run: the check is awareness-only, never changes the exit code,
    and its own subject changes rarely, so it is not part of the retained landing gate (build,
    units, engine, goldens). Run it explicitly when landing a change that touches
    HitchMonitor.cs, HitchSidecar.cs, or the hitch tick in Launcher.cs, or periodically otherwise;
    a run without -Hitch names it in the summary's "not checked:" lines with that same cadence.
    Ignored under -Quick, which never runs it. Always the last stage to launch Godot, so its
    wall-time evidence is never taken beside engine, golden, or perf load (LOG-13, PERF-12/13/14).

.PARAMETER SkipHitch
    Force the hitch-detector check off even if -Hitch is also given. The check is opt-in by
    default (see -Hitch), so this exists for a caller that always passes -Hitch and still needs to
    suppress it for one run.

.PARAMETER Perf
    Also run the perf stage: every scenario in analysis/perf/scenarios.json under
    --det --perf --no-vsync for a fixed number of SIM frames, one JSON record per scenario
    appended to the git-ignored perf-history.jsonl at the repo root. It measures and records;
    it never judges. A regression verdict comes from a paired A/B (-PerfCompare), never from a
    threshold: machine drift makes a committed number lie (verification METHOD-3, PERF-5).

.PARAMETER PerfLabel
    Tags this run's history records (default "run"). The A/B protocol is: label the baseline,
    flip the one line under test, rebuild, run again with -PerfCompare pointed at that label.

.PARAMETER PerfCompare
    After measuring, pair each scenario against the most recent record carrying this label and
    print the ratios, with the reason each awareness metric is not a verdict. The two builds'
    CSVM.dll hashes are compared too: identical hashes mean the run measured the same binary
    twice, which is a noise floor, not an A/B (METHOD-6).

.PARAMETER PerfFilter
    Substring filter on the perf scenario names.

.PARAMETER PerfIterations
    Launches per scenario, overriding the manifest. The first (manifest "warmups") are discarded:
    a cold OS file cache reshapes a startup profile instead of scaling it (PERF-7).

.PARAMETER PerfFrames
    Sim frames per launch, overriding the manifest.

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1
    Build, the unit tests, the in-engine suites, one summary block, one exit code.

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1 -Filter weapons -SkipUnits
    Build, then only the in-engine suites whose name contains "weapons".

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1 -Suite weapons-fire -SkipUnits -SkipGoldens
    Build, then that one suite exactly -- the targeted engine loop. Hitch is already off by
    default, so nothing extra is needed to keep it out of this loop.

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1 -Hitch -SkipUnits -SkipEngine -SkipGoldens
    Build, then only the hitch-detector check -- the isolated loop for a change to
    HitchMonitor.cs, HitchSidecar.cs, or the hitch tick in Launcher.cs.

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1 -Shards 1
    The same run with the engine stage serial -- the reference path an A/B compares against.

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1 -Quick
    The broad partial gate: build, the quick unit tier, the quick engine tier, and a summary
    naming every surface it did not check.

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1 -Perf -PerfLabel base -SkipUnits -SkipEngine -SkipGoldens
    Measure the perf scenario set and file it under the label "base". Flip the one line under
    test, then repeat with -PerfLabel change -PerfCompare base for the paired verdict.

.EXAMPLE
    $env:CSVM_DATA_ROOT = 'Z:\Crimson Skies'; .\RunTests.ps1
    The same run from a git worktree, reading the primary tree's data and Godot.

.EXAMPLE
    .\RunTests.ps1 -GoldenWorkers 1 -SkipUnits -SkipEngine
    The golden stage serial -- the reference path an A/B compares against.

# without std handles, the non-console binary calls AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS) and reopens
# stdout on CONOUT$, writing straight to the console screen buffer, past whatever the caller
# redirected; that is how a run can measure 0 captured lines while its text lands on screen anyway

# completion inside one _Ready call and never yields a frame (same reason goldens is a scripted
# pass, above). Two launches instead, mirroring the goldens/perf shape: one clean, one carrying a
# known --hitch-inject= stall, each read back through its own engine --log-file plus the
# .hitches.jsonl sidecar HitchSidecar writes beside the PROJECT's own log (Log.SinkPath) -- not
# Godot's --log-file, which is a different file; the sidecar's path is recovered from the
# "[core] log file=..." line every session prints once at Log.Open.
#
# Opt-in (-Hitch) and placed last, after perf: HitchMonitor/HitchSidecar landed once and have
# taken exactly one substantive change since (a queue-size tune found by a controls capture, not
# by this stage), the check never changes the exit code, and it is a self-test of the detector's
# own plumbing, not a gameplay regression net -- it is not part of the retained landing gate (build,
# units, engine, goldens). Running it last, after every other Godot launch in this invocation has
# already completed, keeps workstation contention from a sibling stage out of its wall-time
# evidence (LOG-13, PERF-12/13/14).

# Security policy

CSVM is an offline desktop application. Its code opens no network sockets and contacts no
server: multiplayer is splitscreen on one machine, and there is no update check, telemetry
or account. What the build does do is parse a lot of binary and JSON that came off disk,
which is where its realistic security surface is.

## Supported versions

The most recent release on the [releases
page](https://github.com/Laeresh/CSVM/releases). Older releases get no fixes; a fix goes
into the next release.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private reporting: **[Report a
vulnerability](https://github.com/Laeresh/CSVM/security/advisories/new)** on the Security
tab. Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.

Include the build version, what an attacker gets, and the smallest input or steps that
reproduce it. If a file triggers it, attach the file rather than describing it.

If that page does not open for you, open an ordinary issue saying only that you have a
security report and asking where to send it. Do not put the details in it; a private
channel will be opened for you.

A report is read and answered in the advisory thread, and the advisory is where the fix and
any credit are recorded. There is no bounty, and no schedule to promise: this is one
person's project. If you would like to be named in the advisory, say so.

## In scope

- The file parsers in the engine: the readers for extracted archives, meshes, textures,
  animation and mission data, reached by pointing a build at a prepared `extracted` folder.
- The per-user state files under `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\CSVM` (settings, bindings,
  campaign profiles, scores, custom planes), and the optional `config.json`.
- The extraction scripts (`Extract.cmd`, `Extract.ps1`, `ExtractAssets.ps1`,
  `ExtractRof.ps1`) and how they handle the path they are given.
- The release zip's contents differing from what the release page's SHA-256 says they are.

## Out of scope

- **The Windows SmartScreen warning.** Releases are deliberately not code-signed; the
  release page's SHA-256 is the check that carries meaning, and the zip's `README.md`
  says so.
- **The retail Crimson Skies game**, its files and its installer. Not this project's code.
- Anything that needs an attacker to already be running code as you on your own machine.
- Vulnerabilities in the upstream projects this build carries, [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
  and [mech3ax](https://github.com/TerranMechworks/mech3ax). Report those to them; tell us
  as well if a CSVM release ships an affected build, and the release will be rebuilt.

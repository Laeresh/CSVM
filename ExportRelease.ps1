<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds CSVM, exports the "Windows Desktop" release preset, and stages the whole
    friend-facing release payload in .scratch\export\. With -Linux it also exports the
    "Linux/X11" preset and packages the Linux tarball.

.DESCRIPTION
    The packaging entry point (see PROJECT_CONTEXT.md "Exporting a release build" and
    docs/tooling.md). Runs `dotnet build`, imports the project headless (needed once per
    fresh tree before an export can see every asset), exports the release preset defined
    in CSVM/export_presets.cfg, then copies the non-export pieces of the release listed
    in packaging/MANIFEST.md next to it, so .scratch\export\ is the zip's contents.

    The zip is CSVM-v<version>-win64.zip, named from CSVM/project.godot's
    application/config/version -- the same key the exported exe's file properties and the
    first line of every log state, so all three agree by construction.

    Copying is what keeps MANIFEST.md's "byte-identical to the repo source" rule true by
    construction: the READMEs and licences are taken from their one home in the
    repo on every export, never forked into a package variant that can drift. The zip takes
    the checkout's bytes (CRLF under autocrlf); the tarball's text files are staged with LF,
    the bytes git stores.

    Two of the zip's files are about the build rather than part of it.
    LICENSE-thirdparty.txt is copied like any other payload row, but it names the Godot
    build, the .NET runtime version and pack, the unzbd crate target and the mech3ax commit
    it was assembled for, and this script re-checks all of them against what it is
    packaging. The tarball ships packaging\LICENSE-thirdparty-linux.txt under that name. BUILD-INFO.txt is the one
    generated file: it records the CSVM and mech3ax commits the two shipped binaries were
    built from, which is what lets a release page state the source each came from.

    Godot's export templates are user-global, not part of this repo, and there is no
    reliable way to install them unattended -- so this script checks for them first and
    throws a clear error naming the one-time setup step instead of letting Godot's own
    export fail cryptically partway through. unzbd.exe is checked the same way: it is a
    local fork build, not a repo artefact.

    -Linux is opt-in and leaves the Windows half untouched: the same run then exports the
    "Linux/X11" preset into .scratch\export-linux\, stages the Linux payload beside it and
    packs CSVM-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz inside WSL (Debian), because only a tar written
    on Linux carries the executable bit that CSVM.x86_64 and tools/unzbd need. A zip made
    here cannot, which is why the Linux download is a tarball.

.PARAMETER Linux
    Also export the Linux build and package the .tar.gz. Needs the Linux export templates
    and a WSL Debian distro with tar, plus, unless -LinuxUnzbd is given, the Rust musl
    toolchain in that distro (docs/tooling.md, "-Linux").

.PARAMETER LinuxUnzbd
    An existing Linux unzbd binary to ship as tools/unzbd, skipping the build. Without it,
    -Linux builds the mech3ax checkout for x86_64-unknown-linux-musl inside WSL (Debian;
    the cargo target dir is ~/cargo-target/mech3ax in the distro) and copies the binary
    to tools\mech3ax\target\x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\release\unzbd before shipping it.

.EXAMPLE
    .\ExportRelease.ps1
    Build, import, export to .scratch\export\CSVM.exe, and stage the release files.

.EXAMPLE
    .\ExportRelease.ps1 -Linux
    The same, then the Linux export in .scratch\export-linux\ and its tarball.

.EXAMPLE
    .\ExportRelease.ps1 -ToolsRoot Z:\CSVM
    The same from a worktree, taking Godot, unzbd.exe, SDL2 and the mech3ax fork from the main
    checkout's tools\, since tools\ is git-ignored and a worktree has none.

.PARAMETER ToolsRoot
    The checkout whose tools\ folder holds Godot, SDL2 and the mech3ax fork. Defaults to this
    script's own folder, or to CSVM_DATA_ROOT when this folder has no tools\godot (a worktree),
    the same fallback RunTests.ps1 uses. Only the tools move: the build, the payload and the
    recorded CSVM commit stay this tree's own.

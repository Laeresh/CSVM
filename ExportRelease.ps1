<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Builds CSVM, exports the "Windows Desktop" release preset, and stages the whole
    friend-facing release payload in .scratch\export\.

.DESCRIPTION
    The packaging entry point (see PROJECT_CONTEXT.md "Exporting a release build" and
    docs/tooling.md). Runs `dotnet build`, imports the project headless (needed once per
    fresh tree before an export can see every asset), exports the release preset defined
    in CSVM/export_presets.cfg, then copies the non-export pieces of the release listed
    in packaging/MANIFEST.md next to it, so .scratch\export\ is the zip's contents.

    The zip is CSVM-v<version>-win64.zip, named from CSVM/project.godot's
    application/config/version -- the same key the exported exe's file properties and the
    first line of every log state, so all three agree by construction.

    Copying is what keeps MANIFEST.md's "byte-identical to the repo source" rule true by
    construction: the extractor scripts and licences are taken from their one home in the
    repo on every export, never forked into a package variant that can drift.

    Two of the zip's files are about the build rather than part of it.
    LICENSE-thirdparty.txt is copied like any other payload row, but it names the Godot
    build, the .NET runtime version and the mech3ax commit it was assembled for, and this
    script re-checks all three against what it is packaging. BUILD-INFO.txt is the one
    generated file: it records the CSVM and mech3ax commits the two shipped binaries were
    built from, which is what lets a release page state the source each came from.

    Godot's export templates are user-global, not part of this repo, and there is no
    reliable way to install them unattended -- so this script checks for them first and
    throws a clear error naming the one-time setup step instead of letting Godot's own
    export fail cryptically partway through. unzbd.exe is checked the same way: it is a
    local fork build, not a repo artefact.

.EXAMPLE
    .\ExportRelease.ps1
    Build, import, export to .scratch\export\CSVM.exe, and stage the release files.
